**I.**

Alice is considering buying a house.  

爱丽丝正在考虑买房子。

Alice lives in Littleton, Colorado. While she hasn’t decided whether she will buy or rent, she knows she wants a house, not an apartment or condo. In a stroke of great fortune, she finds two eerily identical but beautiful houses on the same block. The only difference: one is for sale, and one is available for rent.  

爱丽丝住在科罗拉多州的利特尔顿市。虽然她还没有决定是买还是租，但她知道她想要一栋房子，而不是公寓或寓所。在一次巨大的幸运中，她在同一个街区发现了两座极其相同但又漂亮的房子。唯一的区别是：一栋是出售的，一栋是出租的。

While Alice is an incredible, unique person, her housing desires are exactly average. As such, she’s relieved to learn that both houses are _exactly_ at the median price point. The house for sale costs $703,000 — the exact median house price in Littleton — and the house for rent costs $2,950 a month — the exact median rent price for a house in Littleton.  

虽然爱丽丝是一个不可思议的、独特的人，但她对住房的渴望正好是平均水平。因此，当她得知这两套房子的价格都正好是中位数的时候，她松了一口气。出售的房子价格为70.3万美元--正好是利特尔顿的房价中位数，而出租的房子价格为每月2950美元--正好是利特尔顿房子的租金中位数。

She loves both houses. The only question: is it financially smarter to buy or rent?  

她喜欢这两所房子。唯一的问题是：从财务上来说，买房还是租房更明智？

Alice assumes she should buy, since she is _the_ target demographic for getting a mortgage. She’s diligently worked a steady job for 10 years, gotten promoted, and accumulated a healthy pile of money into a savings account. Not an extravagant pile; she can’t all-cash-offer a new house. But enough for a responsible 20% down payment. She’s married and just gave birth to her darling child, Alice Jr. They’ll live wherever they move for the next 18 years, until Alice Jr. goes to college.  

爱丽丝认为她应该购买，因为她是获得抵押贷款的目标人群。她勤奋地做了10年稳定的工作，得到了晋升，并在储蓄账户中积累了一大堆钱。这不是一个奢侈的堆积；她不能全盘托出一个新房子。但足以支付负责任的20%的首付款。她结婚了，刚刚生下她可爱的孩子，小爱丽丝。在接下来的18年里，他们将住在任何地方，直到小爱丽丝上大学。

“A new opportunity to take on debt!”  

"一个承担债务的新机会！"

Even though Alice is the target demographic for buying a house, she tells her partner: we should do the math to be _sure_ that it makes sense financially.  

尽管爱丽丝是买房的目标人群，但她告诉她的伙伴：我们应该计算一下，以确定它在财务上是否合理。

And by do the math, she means use the [NY Times calculator](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) for deciding to rent or buy. She plugs in the numbers: $703K total cost, 20% down payment, 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 7%, live there for 18 years, assume the stock market returns 7% annually, and assume the Fed gets its act together for 2% inflation.  

她所说的计算，是指使用《纽约时报》的计算器来决定是租还是买。她输入的数字是：70.3万美元的总成本，20%的首付，30%的固定利率抵押贷款，在那里生活18年，假设股市每年回报率为7%，并假设美联储得到2%的通货膨胀。

With those fixed, Alice notices _wow, changes in housing prices make a huge difference_. (For simplicity, assume home prices and rent rise or fall together, at the same rate.) A few scenarios:  

有了这些固定的，爱丽丝的通知哇，住房价格的变化产生了巨大的差异。(为简单起见，假设房屋价格和租金一起上升或下降，速度相同）。有几种情况。

1.  **Housing prices rise dramatically.** President John Nimbyism wins in a landslide and decrees no new homes can be built, leading housing prices to rise 6% annually. After 18 years, the price of Alice’s house nearly triples. The whole process of buying (and at the end, selling) the house costs Alice ~$1.1M. By buying instead of renting, Alice saves $600K. Thanks to the money saved, Alice can afford to send Alice Jr. to future-Harvard, which has jacked up tuition to $150K a semester by then.  
    
    房价急剧上升。总统约翰-尼姆比主义以压倒性优势获胜，并下令不能建造新的房屋，导致住房价格每年上涨6%。18年后，爱丽丝的房子的价格几乎翻了三倍。购买（以及最后出售）房子的整个过程花费了爱丽丝110万美元。通过购买而不是租房，爱丽丝节省了60万美元。由于省下的钱，爱丽丝有能力把小爱丽丝送到未来的哈佛大学，那时哈佛大学的学费已经涨到了每学期15万美金。
    
2.  **Housing prices rise moderately.** Housing prices rise 4%. Alice’s home value doubles, but she’s only _barely_ better off buying. Over 18 years, renting would have cost her a few tens of thousand dollars. She’s grateful she bought, but her life wouldn’t be much different had she rented.  
    
    住房价格适度上涨。房价上涨4%。爱丽丝的房屋价值翻了一番，但她买房也只是勉强好点。在18年里，租房会花费她几万美元。她很庆幸自己买了房，但如果她租房的话，她的生活也不会有什么变化。
    
3.  **Housing prices only keep pace with inflation.** America realizes it totally forgot about a few million homes it built, greatly expanding supply. Housing prices rise only 2%. Alice is much, much worse off for buying. In total, buying costs ~$1.75M, where renting would have cost her ~$1.3M. Because her finances were tied up in the house while the home value has gone up so little, Alice has minimal savings. Her daughter receives some financial aid, but takes on hundreds of thousands of student loan debt to go to college.  
    
    房价只跟上通货膨胀的步伐。美国意识到它完全忘记了它所建造的几百万套住房，大大扩大了供应。房价只上涨了2%。爱丽丝买房的情况要糟糕得多。总的来说，买房的成本是175万美元，而租房的成本是130万美元。由于她的资金被绑在房子上，而房屋价值的上涨却很少，所以爱丽丝的储蓄很少。她的女儿获得了一些财政援助，但为了上大学，她承担了数十万的学生贷款债务。
    

Thinking through these scenarios, Alice feels awkward. Before buying a house, she was worried about housing affordability. She balked at rising rents. She has friends who commute 2 hours each day because they can’t afford housing near them. She hated how expensive homes were, how _unlivable_ her city had become.  

通过这些场景的思考，爱丽丝感到很尴尬。在买房之前，她对住房的可负担性感到担忧。她对不断上涨的租金望而却步。她有朋友每天通勤2小时，因为他们买不起附近的住房。她讨厌房屋有多贵，她的城市变得多么不适合居住。

But now, if she buys a home, she needs housing prices to keep going up to make her decision financially sound. And not just go up, but outpace inflation and — almost certainly — wage growth. Otherwise, she's cost herself hundreds of thousands of dollars. For buying to be worth it, she needs the price of her home to double.  

但现在，如果她买了房子，她需要住房价格继续上涨，以使她的决定在财务上合理。而且不仅仅是上涨，而是要超过通货膨胀率和--几乎可以肯定--工资增长。否则，她会让自己损失几十万美元。为了使买房值得，她需要房屋的价格翻倍。

Alice wants to own a home. She wants to paint the walls a color she likes, to lay down new hardwood floors, to put in effort without feeling like she’s stupidly doing the landlord’s work for them. She wants a place that’s _hers_.  

爱丽丝想拥有一个家。她想把墙刷成她喜欢的颜色，铺上新的硬木地板，付出努力而不觉得自己是在愚蠢地替房东干活。她想要一个属于自己的地方。

But she hates the idea that to do so, she needs to root for her home price to double. She hates that once she buys a home, she needs homes to become less affordable.  

但她讨厌这样的想法，即为了做到这一点，她需要根治她的房屋价格翻倍。她讨厌的是，一旦她买了房，她就需要房屋变得更难负担。

**II.**

I hear advice from the older generation that “buying a house is an investment”.  

我听到老一辈人的建议，"买房子是一种投资"。

On one level, I get that. Buying a house is a better way to spend money than renting, because at the end, you have something. You have a whole frigging house.  

在某种程度上，我明白这一点。买房是比租房更好的花钱方式，因为最后，你有了一些东西。你有一整个该死的房子。

On another level, I think that the idea that home prices should outpace inflation is insane and maybe has broken modern society.  

在另一个层面上，我认为房价应该超过通货膨胀的想法是疯狂的，也许已经打破了现代社会。

When you invest in a company, you expect the stock price to rise because the company becomes more productive. It hires employees and buys resources to develop technology, improve processes, and eventually produce more widgets, services, or addictive digital videos. The company becomes worth more because it has generated, and can generate, more.  

当你投资一家公司时，你期望股票价格上涨，因为公司变得更有生产力。它雇用员工和购买资源，以开发技术，改善流程，并最终生产更多的部件、服务或令人上瘾的数字视频。公司变得更有价值，因为它已经产生，并且能够产生更多。

When you invest in a home, you expect the price to rise because _\*shrugs\*_ it just does.  

当你投资房屋时，你期望价格上涨，因为\*耸耸肩\*它就是这样。

Some people say home prices rise because of “sweat equity”, i.e., the work homeowners do improving the house.  

有些人说房价上涨是因为 "血汗钱"，即房主为改善房屋所做的工作。

With all due respect, this is a crock of shit. Yes, if a homeowner spends a bunch of time and money improving their house, the price of the house will rise more than the cost of the improvements. But a tasteful new countertop and shiny appliances don’t _double_ the value of the house.  

恕我直言，这是一派胡言。是的，如果房主花了大量的时间和金钱来改善他们的房子，房子的价格将上升到超过改善的成本。但一个有品位的新台面和闪亮的电器并不能使房子的价值翻倍。

Moreover, houses are pretty much the only physical good that are expected to 1) appreciate in value, and 2) be used all the time. Oil paintings and Faberge eggs appreciate in value, but they’re put behind glass cases so that they remain in the exact same state they were in when purchased. Tellingly, they appreciate in value not because they’re useful but because they’re _rare_.  

此外，房子几乎是唯一被期望1）升值，和2）一直被使用的实物商品。油画和Faberge鸡蛋会升值，但它们被放在玻璃柜后面，所以它们保持着与购买时完全相同的状态。有意思的是，它们升值不是因为它们有用，而是因为它们很稀有。

All other physical goods — cars, beds, furniture, appliances — lose value with time. Your car loses value the moment you drive it off the lot. You can’t sell a couch on Craigslist, charge double the retail price, and claim “It’s worth more because I put a lot of sweaty equity into this baby.” You use it, it takes wear-and-tear, and you resell it at a discount.  

所有其他实物商品--汽车、床、家具、电器--都会随着时间而失去价值。你的车在你把它开出停车场的那一刻就失去了价值。你不能在Craigslist上出售沙发，收取双倍的零售价，并声称 "它的价值更高，因为我在这个宝贝上投入了大量的汗水。"你使用它，它需要磨损，然后你以折扣价转卖它。

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F93baabdc-dcc7-48de-b329-35847a695d5a_499x333.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93baabdc-dcc7-48de-b329-35847a695d5a_499x333.png)

“It’s a fixer-upper.” "这是个修修补补的地方。"

Meanwhile, housing gets tons of wear-and-tear. You move furniture around and it scuffs up your beautiful hardwood. A water pipe breaks and floods a room, and it takes months to fix the water damage. Your kid decides indoor baseball-hockey is gonna blow up and slapshots a baseball through a window. And yet, the price of your house goes up.  

同时，住房得到了大量的磨损和撕裂。你把家具搬来搬去，把你漂亮的硬木擦得稀巴烂。水管破裂，淹没了一个房间，需要几个月的时间来修复水渍。你的孩子决定室内棒球-曲棍球会爆炸，并把棒球打到窗户上。然而，你的房子的价格却上升了。

In this way, our expectations for housing are bizarre.  

这样一来，我们对住房的期望就很奇怪了。

In other realms, we expect new versions of consumer goods to 1) do more than their old counterparts, 2) be cheaper relative to inflation, or 3) both. Cars can now instantly show where they are and find directions to anywhere. A fraction of a standard modern television screen has higher resolution than the best TVs 30 years ago. Despite those improvements, [cars](https://www.officialdata.org/inflation-cpi-categories#All-items|New-cars) and [televisions](https://www.officialdata.org/inflation-cpi-categories#All-items|Televisions) (and [furniture](https://www.officialdata.org/inflation-cpi-categories#All-items|Furniture-and-bedding), and [apparel](https://www.officialdata.org/inflation-cpi-categories#All-items|Apparel), and just [durable goods in general](https://www.officialdata.org/inflation-cpi-categories#All-items|Durables)) have all gotten much cheaper on an inflation-adjusted basis over the last 30 years.  

在其他领域，我们期望新版本的消费品：1）比旧版本做得更多，2）相对于通货膨胀更便宜，或3）两者兼而有之。现在，汽车可以立即显示它们所在的位置，并找到去任何地方的方向。一个标准的现代电视屏幕的一小部分比30年前最好的电视的分辨率更高。尽管有这些改进，汽车和电视（还有家具、服装，以及一般的耐用品）在过去30年里都在通货膨胀的基础上变得更便宜了。

Meanwhile, for housing, we expect that a 40-year old house with a bunch of renovations is somehow worth more than it was when it was built. We’d be _surprised_ if it weren’t.  

同时，对于住房来说，我们期望一个40年的老房子，经过一堆装修后，在某种程度上比它建成时的价值更高。如果不是这样，我们会感到惊讶。

It’s worth more because, like oil paintings and Faberge eggs, it’s rare.  

它的价值更高，因为像油画和法贝热彩蛋一样，它很罕见。

When my parents — lovingly but prematurely — gave me advice on buying a house, they said: _choose based on the neighborhood_. Was it up-and-coming? Would more people be moving there? Would the neighborhood go up in value over the next 10-20 years?  

当我的父母--慈爱地但不成熟地--给我买房子的建议时，他们说：根据社区来选择。它是新兴的吗？会有更多的人搬到那里吗？在未来10-20年内，该社区的价值会上升吗？

And that reveals the true nature of housing prices. It’s not about the house, it’s about the location. Housing prices rise where more people want to move, but not enough houses are built to accommodate them. Aggregate housing prices do not rise because everyone’s retiling their bathrooms. They rise because the new demand outstrips the supply.  

而这也揭示了房价的真实本质。这不是房子的问题，而是位置的问题。房价上涨的地方有更多的人想搬走，但没有足够的房子来容纳他们。总的住房价格上涨并不是因为每个人都在重新安装他们的浴室。它们上涨是因为新的需求超过了供应。

The current regime of “housing as an investment” rests on the idea that rising housing prices are good, because they generate wealth. And sure, a homeowner whose house value is rising fast enough is getting wealthier.  

目前 "住房作为一种投资 "的制度建立在这样的想法上：住房价格上涨是好事，因为它们产生财富。当然，房屋价值上涨足够快的房主是越来越富有的。

But it’s a fake version of wealth generation. The majority of the higher value comes from demand outstripping supply. Little actual value is being created, only transferred. Those who own houses gain wealth at the expense of the people who don’t, either through higher prices when buying or renting.  

但这是一个假的创富版本。大部分较高的价值来自于需求大于供应。几乎没有实际的价值被创造，只是被转移。那些拥有房子的人以牺牲没有房子的人的利益为代价获得财富，要么是通过购买或租赁时的高价。

Real wealth generation should create value_._ It should create more goods, more services, more capabilities to do things we couldn’t before. But there’s minimal new value reflected in the rising house prices. Sure, there’s your sweat equity. But most of the house value is just “more people want in, and there’s nowhere to put them.”  

真正的财富创造应该创造价值。它应该创造更多的商品，更多的服务，更多的能力来做我们以前做不到的事情。但是，在不断上涨的房价中，反映出的新价值却微乎其微。当然，这有你的汗水。但大部分房子的价值只是 "更多的人想进来，但没有地方可以安置他们。"

For that reason — and I don’t wanted to come off as a polemicist here, but I gotta be honest — it’s not _crazy_ to compare “housing as an investment” to a pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme transfers money from the latecomers to the earlier adopters, often behind the facade of an allegedly amazing product. And while, according the proponents of the pyramid scheme, that product is the _real_ wealth generator, very little wealth is being created. Instead, it’s a little bit of value creation and a whole lot of wealth transfer.  

出于这个原因--我不想在这里成为一个论战者，但我必须诚实--把 "住房作为一种投资 "比作金字塔计划并不疯狂。金字塔计划把钱从后来者转移到早期采用者身上，往往是在所谓的惊人产品的外表下。虽然，根据金字塔计划的支持者，该产品是真正的财富创造者，但所创造的财富却很少。相反，它是一点点的价值创造和一大堆的财富转移。

Again, not a polemicist, but that does describe the housing market pretty well. Specifically, a generational pyramid scheme in which the older generation got in early because they had the crucial advantage of being born before everyone else. With limited housing supply but more demand, housing prices rise, and the younger generation has to pay more.  

同样，我不是一个论战者，但这确实很好地描述了住房市场。具体来说，这是一个代际金字塔计划，老一辈的人很早就进入了这个计划，因为他们有比其他人早出生的关键优势。由于住房供应有限但需求更多，住房价格上涨，年轻一代不得不支付更多。

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F9e290f5e-0e4b-4334-a829-15f4ee174717_1024x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e290f5e-0e4b-4334-a829-15f4ee174717_1024x1024.png)

DALL-E’s best attempt at a housing pyramid scheme  

DALL-E对住房传销的最佳尝试

Worst of all, for this to work out for them, new buyers like Alice need later generations to buy _their_ homes at even _higher_ prices. Just like a pyramid scheme, the only way newer members break even is for _even more_ people to pour their money into the same system.  

最糟糕的是，为了让他们成功，像爱丽丝这样的新买家需要后来者以更高的价格购买他们的房子。就像金字塔计划一样，新成员实现收支平衡的唯一途径是让更多人把钱投入到同一个系统中。

**III.**

That all said, I sympathize with those who advocated for housing as an investment. They didn’t do it with malice; they didn’t intend for it to become a pyramid scheme. Quite the contrary — they thought (and still think!) it’s a good thing, that it helps people.  

综上所述，我很同情那些主张将住房作为投资的人。他们这样做并没有恶意；他们并不打算让它成为一个金字塔计划。恰恰相反--他们认为（现在仍然认为！）这是一件好事，它可以帮助人们。

In the US, a majority of homes (66%) are occupied by their owners.  

在美国，大多数房屋（66%）是由业主居住的。

Moreover, homeownership is the largest source of wealth for Americans, making up 26% of all US wealth.  

此外，房屋所有权是美国人最大的财富来源，占美国所有财富的26%。

And the poorest homeowners have the greatest proportion of their wealth tied up in their homes.  

而最贫穷的房主在他们的财富中被捆绑的比例最大。

It’s easy to see how rising home prices might be a _good_ thing. If most American families own homes, have a ton of wealth tied up in their homes, and the poorest homeowners have the most tied up in their homes, then rising home prices will help most Americans, increase the biggest source of wealth, and help the poorest homeowners most of all. That’s a political platform you can get behind.  

很容易看出，房价上涨可能是一件好事。如果大多数美国家庭拥有住房，有大量的财富被捆绑在他们的房子里，而最贫穷的房主被捆绑在他们的房子里最多，那么房价上涨将帮助大多数美国人，增加最大的财富来源，并帮助最贫穷的房主。这是一个你可以支持的政治纲领。

So rather than trigger alarm bells, steadily rising home prices were applauded. They meant people were getting wealthier; they meant people were lifted out of poverty.  

因此，稳步上升的房价并没有引发警钟，而是受到赞扬。它们意味着人们变得更加富有；它们意味着人们摆脱了贫困。

Honestly, if I were an adult 40 years ago, I would have thought this.  

说实话，如果我是40年前的成年人，我也会这样想。

But from where we are now, home prices forever growing faster than wages and inflation seems… really bad.  

但从我们现在的情况来看，房价的增长速度永远比工资快，通货膨胀似乎......非常糟糕。

The poorest _homeowners_ may have the greatest proportion of their wealth tied up in their homes, but the bottom half of Americans (by income) are overwhelmingly less likely to own homes than the top half.  

最贫穷的房主可能有最大比例的财富被束缚在他们的房子里，但底层的一半美国人（按收入计算）绝大部分都比上层的一半人更不可能拥有住房。

As housing gets more and more expensive, that bottom half is less and less likely to ever own a home. Worse, more expensive homes drive up rents, meaning those who don’t own a home spend more on rent, and can’t even save up enough money to invest in anything, much less housing. Those forces together widen the chasm between homeowners and the renter underclass.  

随着住房越来越贵，底层民众拥有住房的可能性越来越小。更糟糕的是，更昂贵的房屋促使租金上涨，这意味着那些没有住房的人在租金上花费更多，甚至无法攒下足够的钱来投资任何东西，更不用说住房。这些力量共同扩大了房主和租房下层人士之间的鸿沟。

So if your goal is to lift up the poor with rising home prices, it’s a losing game.  

因此，如果你的目标是用房价上涨来提升穷人的地位，那就是一个失败的游戏。

Also, limiting upward mobility for a third of society is a problem.  

另外，限制社会三分之一的人向上流动也是一个问题。

Idealistically, people should have the opportunity to flourish. But with [average home prices at exceeding half a million dollars](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ASPUS), it takes a while to save enough to buy. Even a 30-something who has held down a good job, gotten promoted, and not eaten avocado toast or whatever may still be unable to afford a house. They see that they’re stuck, that housing will devour their income. From a humane standpoint, that’s not great.  

理想的情况下，人们应该有机会蓬勃发展。但是，随着平均房价超过50万美元，需要一段时间才能存够钱买。即使是一个30多岁的人，如果保持了一份好的工作，得到了晋升，并且没有吃牛油果吐司或其他东西，可能仍然买不起房子。他们看到自己被困住了，住房将吞噬他们的收入。从人道的角度来看，这并不是好事。

But even from a pragmatic standpoint, this situation is a recipe for instability.  

但即使从务实的角度来看，这种情况也是不稳定的因素。

People with nothing invested in the current system have no reason to uphold it. Millennials and Gen Z love Bernie Sanders and AOC because they talk about throwing out the system. If that sounds destabilizing, remember that Bernie Sanders and AOC are still normal candidates following all the normal rules of our political system. They throw the word “revolution” about, but really, they just want people to vote for them the normal way. If housing gets drastically more unattainable and the renter class has even less invested in the system, they might support people who have more interest in guillotines than ballot boxes.  

对现行制度没有任何投资的人，没有理由维护它。千禧一代和Z世代喜欢伯尼-桑德斯和AOC，因为他们谈论的是扔掉这个系统。如果这听起来很不稳定，请记住，伯尼-桑德斯和AOC仍然是正常的候选人，遵循我们政治制度的所有正常规则。他们把 "革命 "一词挂在嘴边，但实际上，他们只是想让人们以正常的方式投票给他们。如果住房变得更加遥不可及，租房者阶层对制度的投资更少，他们可能会支持那些对断头台比投票箱更感兴趣的人。

I don’t think there’s a clean way out. As much as I want housing to be affordable, plummeting housing prices wouldn’t be _great_ for societal stability either. While the rich are more likely to own homes, tons of middle class and poor people also bought homes and planned their lives under the assumption that housing prices would go up. Tanking housing prices would destroy their trust in the system that they bet everything on.  

我不认为有一个干净的出路。尽管我希望住房是可负担的，但房价暴跌对社会稳定也不是好事。虽然富人更有可能拥有住房，但大量的中产阶级和穷人也购买了住房，并在假设房价会上涨的情况下规划自己的生活。房价暴跌会破坏他们对这个系统的信任，他们把一切都押在这个系统上。

By setting the expectation that housing prices rise like a stock portfolio, we’ve created an unwinnable situation.  

通过设定住房价格像股票投资组合一样上涨的预期，我们已经创造了一个不可赢的局面。

Homeowners expect their home prices to rise. In some cases, slowing home prices will legitimately make their lives much harder.  

房主们期望他们的房屋价格能够上涨。在某些情况下，放缓的房价将合法地使他们的生活更加困难。

Meanwhile, renters are desperate. They’re begging for housing prices not just to slow, but to fall.  

同时，租房者也很绝望。他们恳求住房价格不仅要放缓，而且要下降。

And that’s what worries me most: whatever policy we pursue, I see no way both sides thrive. Treating housing as an investment has made it so that for one side to succeed, the other must pay.  

这也是我最担心的地方：无论我们采取什么政策，我都看不到双方的繁荣。把住房作为一项投资，使得一方要成功，另一方必须付出代价。
