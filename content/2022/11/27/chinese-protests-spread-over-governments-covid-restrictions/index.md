---

Protests are erupting in several major cities in China over President Xi Jinping’s [zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-weighs-zero-covid-exit-but-proceeds-with-caution-and-without-timeline-11667826209?mod=article_inline), an unusual show of defiance in the country as the [economic and social costs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-recovery-hopes-crushed-by-record-covid-outbreak-as-lockdowns-spread-11669276266?mod=article_inline) from snap lockdowns and other strict restrictions escalate.

The protests followed demonstrations on Friday in Urumqi, the capital of the remote region of Xinjiang, where a deadly fire enraged city residents who had struggled with [lockdowns of more than 100 days](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-xinjiang-region-has-been-locked-down-for-months-casting-shadow-over-zero-covid-easing-11669371218?mod=article_inline). Residents flooded social media with comments suggesting the government’s Covid restrictions contributed to a delay in putting out the fire, in which officials said 10 people died.

周五在新疆偏远地区的首府乌鲁木齐举行了示威活动，一场致命的火灾激怒了 [在 100 多天的封锁中](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-xinjiang-region-has-been-locked-down-for-months-casting-shadow-over-zero-covid-easing-11669371218?mod=article_inline) 苦苦挣扎的城市居民。 居民们纷纷在社交媒体上发表评论，称政府的 Covid 限制措施导致火灾扑救延迟，官员称有 10 人在火灾中丧生。

On Saturday, videos circulating on social media showed crowds gathering on a street in central Shanghai calling for a lifting of the lockdowns. The videos were verified by Storyful, a social-media research company owned by [](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NWSA)[News Corp](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NWSA), parent company of The Wall Street Journal.

周六，社交媒体上流传的视频显示，人群聚集在上海市中心的一条街道上，呼吁解除封锁。 旗下社交媒体研究公司 Storyful 的验证。 [](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NWSA)[新闻集团](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NWSA) 这些视频得到了华尔街日报母公司

One clip showed protesters standing around a street sign that says Wulumuqi Middle Road, named after Urumqi, suggesting the protests were inspired by protests in that city on Friday. Using expletives and call-and-response chanting, they were denouncing Mr. Xi’s Covid-control strategy. Another clip from the scene showed demonstrators standing across from lines of police.

一段视频显示，抗议者站在一个以乌鲁木齐命名的乌鲁木齐中路的路牌周围，暗示抗议活动是受到周五该市抗议活动的启发。 他们用咒骂和呼喊口号来谴责习近平的新冠病毒控制策略。 现场的另一个片段显示，示威者站在警察队伍对面。

The clip showed one man chanting, “The Communist Party.”

视频显示一名男子高喊“共产党”。

Others responded, “Step down.”

其他人回答说：“下台。”

“Xi Jinping,” the one man shouted.

“ 习近平 ，”那人喊道。

“Step down,” others responded.

“下台，”其他人回应道。

Other videos and photographs circulating online showed students demonstrating at the Communication University of China in the eastern city of Nanjing, with one clip showing some chanting, “Long live the people.”

网上流传的其他视频和照片显示，学生们在东部城市南京的中国传媒大学示威，其中一个片段显示有人高呼“人民万岁”。

The Journal spoke to people in both Shanghai and Nanjing, who confirmed that the clips showed events taking place in those cities on Saturday.

《华尔街日报》采访了上海和南京的人士，他们证实这些视频显示了周六在这些城市发生的事件。

In some parts of Beijing, the capital city where security measures are among the tightest in the country, residents were marching out of closed-off compounds earlier Saturday, with some demanding to ease what they called excessive Covid restrictions, according to videos on social media and locals who participated in the actions.

社交媒体上的视频显示，周六早些时候，在安全措施全国最严格的首都北京的一些地区，居民们从封闭的大院里游行，一些人要求放宽他们所谓的过度 Covid 限制以及参与行动的当地人。

On Chinese social-media, users raced against censors to spread images and news of the protests, along with expressions of solidarity. “Long live the people, may the dead rest in peace,” read one message that spread widely.

在中国的社交媒体上，用户与审查员争先恐后地传播抗议的图片和新闻，以及声援的表达。 “人民万岁，愿逝者安息，”一条广为流传的信息写道。

Earlier in the week, workers at the world’s biggest [Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL) iPhone assembly plant clashed with police after protests erupted at the factory in central China, where the sprawling facility employing more than 200,000 people has been [under strict Covid-19 controls for weeks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-factory-workers-clash-with-police-at-covid-hit-plant-in-china-11669193001?mod=article_inline).

本周早些时候，世界上最大的 [苹果](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL) iPhone 组装厂的工人在中国中部的工厂爆发抗议活动后与警方发生冲突，该工厂拥有超过 200,000 名员工 [，数周以来一直受到 Covid-19 的严格控制](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-factory-workers-clash-with-police-at-covid-hit-plant-in-china-11669193001?mod=article_inline) 。

Open displays of anger are rare in China, where crackdowns on dissent have intensified over the past decade under Mr. Xi’s leadership. Having protests over the same issue break out in multiple Chinese cities is almost unheard of, outside of nationalist outpourings, such as anti-Japanese protests. Ever since the student democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the ruling party has worked to prevent public protests from happening.

在中国，公开表达愤怒是罕见的，过去十年来，在习近平的领导下，对异议的镇压力度加大了。 在中国多个城市爆发针对同一问题的抗议活动几乎是闻所未闻的，除了民族主义的爆发，例如反日抗议活动。 自 1989 年天安门广场的学生民主抗议以来，执政党一直在努力防止公众抗议的发生。

The protests highlight the rising toll on Chinese society from [a Covid strategy built around mass testing and confinement](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shanghais-omicron-outbreak-corners-chinese-leader-11649423941?mod=article_inline) to quash even minor outbreaks—an approach that has become increasingly unsustainable.

对中国社会造成的伤亡人数不断上升 [抗议活动凸显出，围绕大规模检测和限制以平息小规模疫情而制定的新冠病毒战略](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shanghais-omicron-outbreak-corners-chinese-leader-11649423941?mod=article_inline) ——这种做法已变得越来越不可持续。

The strategy saved lives and proved effective earlier in the pandemic, which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in early 2020. It has come to underpin Mr. Xi’s view that China has managed the virus better than the West.

该战略挽救了生命，并在 2020 年初在中国中部城市武汉开始的大流行病早期证明是有效的。它已经成为习近平认为中国比西方更好地控制病毒的观点的基础。

However, more contagious strains of Covid-19 have since made it all but impossible to completely clear out the virus. Meanwhile, frequent lockdowns have kept businesses closed and pushed up youth unemployment, with China now facing its worst slowdown in decades.

然而，自那以后，更具传染性的 Covid-19 菌株几乎不可能完全清除该病毒。 与此同时，频繁的封锁使企业停业并推高了青年失业率，中国现在正面临几十年来最严重的经济放缓。

In addition, there have been many reported cases of people who have died of other diseases they couldn’t get treated for because of lockdowns.

此外，还有许多人死于其他因封锁而无法得到治疗的疾病的报道。

Wary of the high stakes, China’s top leadership earlier this month unveiled plans to “optimize and adjust” the strict zero-Covid policy to rescue the economy. However, with keeping Covid under control remaining a top political priority, local officials across the country doubled down on imposing restrictions when cases rose along with the winter season.

出于对高风险的警惕，中国最高领导层本月早些时候公布了“优化和调整”严格的零 Covid 政策以拯救经济的计划。 然而，由于控制 Covid 仍然是首要政治优先事项，全国各地的地方官员在病例随着冬季增加而加倍实施限制。

“A lot of people are reaching the breaking point,” said Yanzhong Huang, a public-health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, who has been closely monitoring the Covid situation in China.

“很多人都到了崩溃 黄延中说，他一直在密切关注中国的 Covid 形势。 的边缘，”外交关系委员会的公共卫生专家

Mr. Huang and several other analysts compared the waves of Covid-related protests to the public sentiment around the 1989 Tiananmen protests.

黄先生和其他几位分析人士将与新冠病毒相关的抗议浪潮与 1989 年天安门抗议活动前后的公众情绪进行了比较。

“If mishandled by the government, the highly volatile situation could quickly evolve into the most severe political crisis since Tiananmen,” said Mr. Huang.

“如果政府处理不当，高度动荡的局势可能会迅速演变成自天安门以来最严重的政治危机，”黄先生说。

Video clips from Shanghai showed police dragging some protesters away while others were chanting, “Let go!”

来自上海的视频片段显示，警察将一些抗议者拖走，而其他人则高呼“放手！”

At the Communication University in Nanjing, a male student said to a cheering crowd: “I speak for my own hometown, speak for those who lost family members in the \[Urumqi\] fire, and speak for all the compatriots who died across the country.”

在南京传媒大学，一名男学生对着欢呼的人群说：“我为自己的家乡说话，为在\[乌鲁木齐\]火灾中失去亲人的人说话，为全国所有遇难的同胞说话。 ”

A person answering the phone at the Shanghai municipal government said no one was available to answer questions on the weekend. Calls to the Beijing municipal government and to the Communication University in Nanjing rang unanswered.

上海市政府一名接听电话的人士称，周末无人接听。 致电北京市政府和南京传媒大学无人接听。

Urumqi officials said after the fire last week that rescuers had to remove some barriers, but attributed a delay in putting out the fire to too many cars parked in the compound. On Saturday, Urumqi officials said normal activities would gradually resume in areas of the city considered at low risk for Covid.

乌鲁木齐官员表示，上周火灾发生后，救援人员不得不拆除一些障碍物，但将灭火时间延误归因于大院内停放的汽车过多。 周六，乌鲁木齐官员表示，该市被认为感染新冠病毒风险较低的地区将逐步恢复正常活动。
