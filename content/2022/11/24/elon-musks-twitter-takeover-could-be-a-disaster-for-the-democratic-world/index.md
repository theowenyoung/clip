In the United States, the daily news accounts of Twitter’s decline and possible demise can give the impression that Elon Musk’s disastrous early days as the owner of the social media company is a largely American story.

在美国，有关 Twitter 衰落和可能消亡的每日新闻报道给人的印象是，埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 作为这家社交媒体公司所有者的早年灾难性日子主要是美国故事。

One day, the headlines are dominated by Musk polling his Twitter followers to determine whether former U.S. President Donald Trump should be allowed to return to the platform. Unsurprisingly, given Musk’s politics, [he was](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/19/1131351535/elon-musk-allows-donald-trump-back-on-twitter). Another day, the public learns that [Marjorie Taylor Green](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/elon-musks-twitter-reinstates-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene), one of the most radical exponents in Congress of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement, has been granted renewed access to Twitter. And at virtually the same moment, Canadian psychologist and media personality [Jordan Peterson](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/18/23466625/elon-musk-twitter-reinstatement-jordan-peterson-kathy-griffin-babylon-bee), a long-standing provocateur in the United States’ culture wars and notable opponent of the protection of rights of transgender and nonbinary people, was welcomed back to Twitter.

有一天，马斯克对他的 Twitter 追随者进行投票，以确定是否应允许美国前总统唐纳德特朗普返回该平台，成为头条新闻。 不出所料，考虑到马斯克的政治立场， [他是](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/19/1131351535/elon-musk-allows-donald-trump-back-on-twitter) 。 另一天，公众得知 [特朗普“让美国再次伟大”运动国会中最激进的倡导者之一马乔里·泰勒·格林 ( Marjorie Taylor Green](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/elon-musks-twitter-reinstates-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene) ) 已获准重新访问 Twitter。 几乎在同一时刻，加拿大心理学家和媒体名人 [乔丹·彼得森 (Jordan Peterson](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/18/23466625/elon-musk-twitter-reinstatement-jordan-peterson-kathy-griffin-babylon-bee) ) 再次受到欢迎，他是美国文化战争的长期煽动者，也是保护跨性别者和非二元性别者权利的著名反对者。

Anticipating widespread criticism, Musk, who often comes across as a gleeful adolescent and exhibitionist, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594757734267764774?s=20&t=matSUrjp1ECCjmcXdqlbsQ), “Hope all judgy hall monitors stay on other platforms – please, I’m begging u.”

预料到广泛的批评，马斯克经常被认为是一个兴高采烈的青少年和 [爱出风头的人，他在推特](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594757734267764774?s=20&t=matSUrjp1ECCjmcXdqlbsQ) 上写道：“希望所有挑剔的大厅监视器都留在其他平台上——拜托，我求求你了。”

Some prominent U.S. commentators have dismissed what is going on at Twitter. Marketing professor and podcast host [Scott Galloway](https://twitter.com/FaceTheNation/status/1594371558495211524?s=20&t=yCUyqhNfGZdYjFusGy295g), speaking on CBS News’s _Face the Nation_ on Sunday, said the platform is “not a national treasure.” But there are many reasons to mourn the ongoing spectacle. With all of its shortcomings, Twitter has been a powerful agent in the democratization of information over the past generation.

一些著名的美国评论员驳斥了 Twitter 上发生的事情。 营销学教授兼播客主持人 [斯科特·加洛韦](https://twitter.com/FaceTheNation/status/1594371558495211524?s=20&t=yCUyqhNfGZdYjFusGy295g) (Scott Galloway ) 周日在 CBS 新闻的 _“面向全国”( Face the Nation_ ) 节目中表示，该平台“不是国宝”。 但是，有很多理由为正在发生的景象哀悼。 尽管存在所有缺点，但 Twitter 在过去一代中一直是信息民主化的强大推动者。

Depending on one’s age, it may be all too easy to ignore or forget what the human information ecosystem was like a mere generation ago. When I was starting out as a journalist in the early 1980s, the news in my country, the United States, was utterly dominated by a small number of companies, starting with the so-called national newspapers such as the _New York Times_, the _Wall Street Journal_, and the _Washington Post_. Most Americans got their news from the three national television networks—CBS, NBC, and ABC—which mostly took their leads straight from the big papers, allowing their coverage decisions to be especially guided by the _Times_’s front page.

根据一个人的年龄，可能很容易忽略或忘记仅仅一代人之前的人类信息生态系统。 当我在 20 世纪 80 年代初开始当记者时，我的国家美国的新闻完全被少数公司控制，从所谓的全国性报纸开始，如 _纽约时报_ 、 _华尔街日报Street Journal_ 和 _华盛顿邮报_ 。 大多数美国人从三大全国性电视网络——CBS、NBC 和 ABC——获取新闻，这些网络大多直接从大报纸那里获取信息，从而使他们的报道决策尤其受到 _时报头版_ 的指导。

In that era, the United States had a far more vibrant local information scene, with strong competition among daily newspapers in even medium-sized cities. Most of these have disappeared or been gutted by the internet. But for news of the world, even financially strong local papers often relied heavily on the syndicated offerings of the three big national papers.

在那个时代，美国的地方信息环境更加活跃，甚至中等城市的日报之间也存在着激烈的竞争。 其中大部分已经消失或被互联网摧毁。 但对于世界新闻，即使是财力雄厚的地方报纸也常常严重依赖三大全国性报纸的联合发行。

I have worked at one time or another of my career on every continent. And although it is difficult to make a blanket statement covering the news industry globally, for the people of many—and perhaps most—countries, the news diet at this time was far thinner than in the United States and often dominated by official government publications and broadcasters.

在我的职业生涯中，我曾在各大洲工作过一段时间。 尽管很难对全球新闻业做出全面的声明，但对于许多——也许是大多数——国家的人民来说，此时的新闻饮食比美国要单薄得多，而且通常由政府官方出版物和广播公司。

Social media in general, and perhaps Twitter in particular, have helped destroy the old information system. By serving as what economists would call a “multiplier,” they have vastly expanded the range of offerings that we are all exposed to, as well as the reach of both smaller players in the information economy and individuals. Like almost anything so consequential, this has not come without problems and drawbacks, which I will come to in a moment. First, though, more needs to be said about what Musk has been destroying.

总体而言，社交媒体，尤其是推特，已经帮助摧毁了旧的信息系统。 通过充当经济学家所说的“乘数”，它们极大地扩展了我们所有人接触到的产品范围，以及信息经济中较小的参与者和个人的影响范围。 就像几乎所有如此重要的事情一样，这并非没有问题和缺点，我稍后会谈到。 不过，首先，关于马斯克一直在摧毁的东西，需要多说几句。

Others have [commented](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/opinion/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-india.html) on the destruction of all sorts of human networks and communities as Twitter suffers a battering from within. If predictions of Twitter’s ultimate demise are not utterly premature, I, for one, will find it immeasurably harder to do what I do. As a journalist with far-flung interests, that means staying abreast of information in every corner of Africa, in northeastern Asia, in academic history circles in the United States, in the publishing industry, and in many other areas. In addition to its reach, Twitter has allowed people like me to curate their sources by following people who are reliably interesting—and relatively reliable in the quality of information they share.

其他人 [评论](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/opinion/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-india.html) 了各种人类网络和社区的破坏，因为 Twitter 遭受了内部的打击。 如果对 Twitter 最终消亡的预测不是完全过早的话，我个人会发现做我所做的事情要困难得多。 作为一名志趣相投的记者，这意味着要及时了解非洲各个角落、东北亚、美国学术史界、出版界等诸多领域的信息。 除了影响力之外，Twitter 还允许像我这样的人通过关注那些可靠有趣且在他们分享的信息质量上相对可靠的人来管理他们的资源。

In recent days, I have been experimenting with some of the new alternatives to Twitter, such as Post.News. But however promising some of them look, it will be hard—or, more likely, impossible—to reconstruct some of what years of careful Twitter use had built for me and millions of others.

最近几天，我一直在尝试一些 Twitter 的新替代品，例如 Post.News。 但是，无论它们中的一些看起来多么有前途，都很难——或者更可能是不可能——重建我和其他数百万人多年来谨慎使用 Twitter 所建立的一些东西。

If these strike readers as relatively mundane considerations, there is one other way to think about the damage being done to Twitter that is the opposite of parochial, American or otherwise. Galloway notwithstanding, the destruction of Twitter would be a geopolitical catastrophe not only for the United States but also for the democratic world in general. With his shallow understanding of freedom of speech, these stakes seem to escape Musk.

如果这些让读者觉得是相对平凡的考虑，那么还有另一种方式来考虑对 Twitter 造成的损害，这种方式与狭隘的、美国的或其他方式相反。 尽管有加洛韦，推特的毁灭将不仅对美国而且对整个民主世界来说都是一场地缘政治灾难。 以他对言论自由浅薄的理解，这些赌注似乎逃脱了马斯克。

As the world’s leading authoritarian society, China’s response to Twitter and other Western social media was to allow only stringently policed conversations on authorized (or at least not forbidden) topics on platforms such as Weibo. Musk’s free speech absolutism might seem like the opposite, but, in fact, it represents an abdication of responsibility and good sense in the name of his personal ideology.

作为世界领先的专制社会，中国对 Twitter 和其他西方社交媒体的回应是只允许在微博等平台上就授权（或至少不被禁止）的话题进行严格监管的对话。 马斯克的言论自由专制主义似乎恰恰相反，但实际上，它代表着以个人意识形态的名义放弃责任和理智。

It is true that Twitter has long allowed some level of disinformation and fake news on its platform, and that in some circles there was always lots of shouting, falsity, and ugliness. But the company expended considerable energy to keep things within bounds and enforce standards. By allowing virtually anything to appear on Twitter—no matter how hurtful, untrue, irresponsible, or even hateful—through the [gutting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/22/elon-musk-twitter-content-moderations/) of the platform’s Trust and Safety unit, Musk is destroying free speech in the name of saving it.

的确，Twitter 长期以来一直允许在其平台上发布某种程度的虚假信息和假新闻，而且在某些圈子里总是有很多喧嚣、虚假和丑陋的东西。 但该公司花费了大量精力来将事情控制在界限内并执行标准。 允许几乎任何东西出现在 Twitter 上——无论多么伤人、不真实、不负责任，甚至是仇恨——通过 [摧毁](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/22/elon-musk-twitter-content-moderations/) 平台的信任和安全部门，马斯克正在以拯救言论自由的名义摧毁它。

If things continue down this path, we will end up in a situation where democratic countries will have proved themselves as incapable as authoritarian ones in providing for untrammeled communication and the sharing of information globally.

如果事情继续沿着这条道路发展下去，我们最终将陷入民主国家将证明自己在提供不受限制的沟通和全球信息共享方面与专制国家一样无能为力的局面。

This, and not Musk’s shallow and sterile vision, would be the true defeat of free speech. And there is no one who would be happier than its most powerful sworn enemies, the authoritarians. Listen carefully, and you may already hear them clucking.

这，而不是马斯克浅薄而贫乏的愿景，将是言论自由的真正失败。 没有人会比它最强大的死敌——威权主义者更快乐。 仔细听，您可能已经听到它们的咯咯声。
