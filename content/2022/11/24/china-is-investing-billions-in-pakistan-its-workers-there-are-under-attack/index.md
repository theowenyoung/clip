## 中国在巴基斯坦投资数十亿美元。 它的工人在那里受到攻击。

## Beijing’s Belt and Road investment strategy meets resistance in the developing world it seeks to influence.

## 北京的“一带一路”投资战略在其试图影响的发展中国家遇到阻力。

KARACHI, Pakistan—In April, a Pakistani mother of two blew herself up outside the gate of Karachi University’s Chinese language and culture institute, incinerating a minibus and killing three Chinese teachers and a Pakistani driver.

巴基斯坦卡拉奇——今年 4 月，一位巴基斯坦籍两个孩子的母亲在卡拉奇大学中国语言文化学院门口引爆了自己，引爆了一辆小巴，炸死了三名中国教师和一名巴基斯坦司机。

The attack—one of a growing number targeting Chinese nationals working abroad in Asia and Africa—was a sign of China’s deepening challenges as it pours money into the developing world with the aim of extending its influence.

这次袭击是越来越多针对在亚洲和非洲工作的中国公民的袭击之一，表明中国在向发展中国家投入资金以扩大其影响力时面临越来越大的挑战。

China is the largest lender to the developing world, mainly through Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road infrastructure program. The country has worked to portray itself as a benevolent partner to the countries where it is spending money, in an attempt to draw a distinction with Western powers.

中国是发展中国家最大的贷款人，主要是通过中国领导人 习近平的 一带一路基础设施计划 。 该国一直努力将自己描绘成它所投资国家的仁慈伙伴，试图与西方列强区分开来。

Still, [as its global reach expands](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-trade-routes-center-it-on-geopolitical-map-1415559290?mod=article_inline), China is increasingly grappling with the consequences of projecting power around the world, including corruption, local resentment, political instability and violence. For developing countries, China offers perhaps the best chance of quickly building major infrastructure.

尽管如此， [随着其全球影响力的扩大](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-trade-routes-center-it-on-geopolitical-map-1415559290?mod=article_inline) ，中国越来越多地应对在世界范围内投射力量的后果，包括腐败、地方不满、政治不稳定和暴力。 对于发展中国家来说，中国或许是快速建设大型基础设施的最佳机会。

China has faced Western criticism that it is pursuing lopsided lending arrangements that drive developing nations into heavy debt without necessarily delivering the desired local economic benefits. But Beijing also has confronted significant risks, from defaults to political unrest that endangers Chinese assets and workers in borrowing countries.  

中国曾面临西方的批评，称它正在推行不平衡的贷款安排，这会使发展中国家背上沉重的债务，但不一定能带来期望的当地经济利益。 但北京也面临重大风险，从违约到危及借款国的中国资产和工人的政治动荡。  

“The Chinese have to come to terms with the fact that these are unstable countries with fragile internal politics,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank. “If you are going to operate here, you are going to encounter these problems.”

“中国人必须接受这样一个事实，即这些国家不稳定，内部政治脆弱，”他说 云孙, 华盛顿智库史汀生中心中国项目主任。 “如果你要在这里经营，就会遇到这些问题。”

Beijing accepts a degree of security risk in pursuing its Belt and Road program and is committed to working with partner governments, such as in Pakistan, to mitigate threats to Chinese personnel and assets, Chinese experts say.

中国专家表示，北京在推行“一带一路”计划时接受了一定程度的安全风险，并致力于与巴基斯坦等伙伴国政府合作，以减轻对中国人员和资产的威胁。

“We couldn’t possibly wait until all terror attacks cease before starting new projects,” said Qian Feng, a senior fellow at Tsinghua University’s National Strategy Institute. “We have to keep working, studying the issues, and undertake preventative measures at the same time.”

清华大学国家战略研究院高级研究员钱峰说：“我们不可能等到所有恐怖袭击都停止后再开始新项目。” “我们必须继续努力，研究问题，同时采取预防措施。”

Chinese businesses and workers in several countries where it is making investments have become favored targets. Chinese nationals are seen as wealthier than most locals and, in some cases, are perceived to be reaping too much of the economic benefits and job opportunities created by Beijing’s investments.

在其投资的多个国家的中国企业和工人成为青睐的目标。 中国人被认为比大多数当地人更富有，而且在某些情况下，他们被认为从北京的投资创造的经济利益和就业机会中收获了太多。

Gunmen in Nigeria abducted four Chinese workers in June during an attack at a mine in the country’s northwest. In October, unidentified “thugs” attacked a Chinese-funded business in Nigeria and killed a Chinese employee there, according to the Chinese consulate in Lagos. The consulate urged Chinese companies to hire private security and fortify their work areas.

尼日利亚的枪手在 6 月袭击该国西北部的一座矿山时绑架了四名中国工人。 据中国驻拉各斯领事馆称，10 月，身份不明的“暴徒”袭击了尼日利亚一家中资企业，并杀害了一名中国员工。 领事馆敦促中国公司聘请私人保安并加强他们的工作区域。

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Chinese investors dominate the mining industry, Chinese business groups and workers have sounded alarms about armed robberies and kidnappings in recent months. Beijing has urged local authorities to step up security for Chinese assets and personnel.

在中国投资者主导采矿业的刚果民主共和国，中国商业团体和工人最近几个月对持械抢劫和绑架事件发出了警报。 北京已敦促地方当局加强对中国资产和人员的安全保护。

There were about 440,000 Chinese people working abroad for Chinese contractors in Asia and roughly 93,500 in Africa at the end of last year, according to the China International Contractors Association, a Beijing-based industry group.

据总部位于北京的行业组织中国对外承包工程商会称，截至去年年底，约有 44 万中国人在亚洲为中国承包商工作，在非洲约有 93,500 人。

The Oxus Society, a Washington-based think tank, counted about 160 incidents of civil unrest in Central Asia between 2018 and mid-2021 where China was the key issue.

总部位于华盛顿的智库 Oxus Society 统计，2018 年至 2021 年中期，中亚发生了约 160 起内乱事件，其中中国是关键问题。

Beijing recognizes the rising threat to its workers in developing countries but doesn’t want to send in its army as it professes noninterference abroad, said Alessandro Arduino, author of “China’s Private Army: Protecting the New Silk Road.” Instead, China is deploying technology such as facial recognition and hiring more private Chinese security contractors, he said.

北京承认其在发展中国家的工人面临的威胁越来越大，但不想派遣军队，因为它声称不干涉国外事务，说 亚历山德罗·阿杜诺， “中国的私人军队：保护新丝绸之路”的作者。 他说，相反，中国正在部署面部识别等技术，并雇用更多的中国私营安全承包商。

China chose Pakistan—one of its closest allies, with deep military ties and a common rival in India—as a showcase of its investment in developing nations. Beijing has spent about $25 billion here on roads, power plants and a port.

中国选择巴基斯坦作为其对发展中国家投资的展示——巴基斯坦是其最亲密的盟友之一，与印度有着深厚的军事联系，也是印度的共同竞争对手。 北京在道路、发电厂和港口方面花费了大约 250 亿美元。

This month, Pakistan’s prime minister,

本月，巴基斯坦总理，

Shehbaz Sharif, made his first trip to Beijing since taking office in April. Both leaders committed to their countries’ partnership.

“China views its relations with Pakistan from a strategic and long-term perspective, and Pakistan has always been a high priority in China’s neighborhood diplomacy,” Mr. Xi said, according to China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

“中国从战略高度和长远角度看待中巴关系，巴基斯坦始终是中国周边外交的优先方向，”据中国外交部称，习近平说。

Mr. Xi also expressed concern about the safety of Chinese nationals in the country. Islamabad told Beijing it could import armored vehicles for protection and that Pakistan would increase its security at some Chinese projects, Pakistani officials said.

习近平还对在该国的中国公民的安全表示担忧。 巴基斯坦官员说，伊斯兰堡告诉北京，它可以进口装甲车进行保护，巴基斯坦将加强对一些中国项目的安保。

After the April attack at the gate of Karachi University, Beijing sought to bring Chinese private security contractors into Pakistan. Islamabad, which provides 30,000 Pakistani soldiers to guard the Chinese, denied the request, according to Pakistani officials.

在卡拉奇大学门口发生 4 月袭击事件后，北京试图将中国私人安保承包商引入巴基斯坦。 据巴基斯坦官员称，伊斯兰堡提供了 30,000 名巴基斯坦士兵保护中国人，但拒绝了这一请求。

The suicide bomber targeted a minibus of teachers returning from lunch to the university’s Confucius Institute, part of Beijing’s global network of schools teaching Chinese language and culture.

这名自杀式炸弹袭击者袭击了一辆小巴上的教师，他们从午餐后返回该大学的孔子学院，该学院是北京教授中国语言和文化的全球学校网络的一部分。

One of the teachers killed, Huang Guiping, helped establish the program about a decade ago and just a month earlier had returned for a second stint as director of its language institute.

一名教师被杀， 黄贵平， 大约十年前帮助建立了这个项目，就在一个月前，他再次担任语言研究所所长。

“Karachi is my second hometown,” Mr. Huang said at the time, according to China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency.

“卡拉奇是我的第二故乡，”据中国官方媒体新华社报道，黄先生当时说。

A Chinese teacher who survived but was badly injured, Wang Yuqing, was flown to China to recover. Another 11 teachers in Karachi, who taught at different colleges in Pakistan’s largest city and weren’t in the minibus attacked, returned to China.

生还但受重伤的中文教师王玉清被空运到中国康复。 卡拉奇的另外 11 名教师返回了中国，他们曾在巴基斯坦最大城市的不同大学任教，但并未在遇袭的小巴中。

“The motherland has brought us back,” said a teacher who flew home in May with the ashes of their deceased colleagues, state-run Xinhua reported.

据官方媒体新华社报道，5 月份带着已故同事的骨灰飞回家的一位教师说：“祖国把我们带回来了。”

The Baloch Liberation Army, the [deadliest separatist group](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-263B-8077?mod=article_inline) in Pakistan’s westernmost province of Balochistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

俾路支解放军声称对这次袭击负责。 [最致命的分离主义组织](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-263B-8077?mod=article_inline) 巴基斯坦最西部省份俾路支省

In September, [a gunman raided a dental practice in Karachi](https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-in-pakistan-probe-whether-attack-on-dental-clinic-was-anti-chinese-11664391605?mod=article_inline) run by an ethnic Chinese couple who had grown up in Pakistan. The assailant shot and injured the dentist and his wife, both in their 70s, and killed their ethnic Chinese cashier. The attack was claimed by a militant group.

9 月， [一名枪手袭击了卡拉奇的一家牙科诊所，该诊所](https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-in-pakistan-probe-whether-attack-on-dental-clinic-was-anti-chinese-11664391605?mod=article_inline) 由一对在巴基斯坦长大的华裔夫妇经营。 袭击者开枪打伤了 70 多岁的牙医和他的妻子，并杀死了他们的华裔收银员。 一个激进组织声称对这次袭击负责。

Pakistan is in the [throes of a political clash](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shots-fired-at-pakistan-protest-rally-held-by-ex-prime-minister-imran-khan-11667478021?mod=article_inline) between the current government and its recently ousted prime minister, Imran Khan. The country is facing inflation running at 25%, plus devastating floods, and it recently secured a bailout from the International Monetary Fund as its foreign exchange reserves dwindle to dangerously low levels. China’s investments in Pakistan were supposed to lay the foundation for an economic takeoff, according to both countries.

巴基斯坦正 [政治冲突的阵痛之中](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shots-fired-at-pakistan-protest-rally-held-by-ex-prime-minister-imran-khan-11667478021?mod=article_inline) 处于现任政府与其最近被罢免的总理伊姆兰汗之间 。 该国正面临着 25% 的通货膨胀率以及毁灭性的洪水，并且随着其外汇储备减少到危险的低水平，该国最近获得了国际货币基金组织的救助。 两国都表示，中国在巴基斯坦的投资本应为经济腾飞奠定基础。

Prime Minister Mr. Sharif pledged to resume China’s Belt and Road program, after it stalled under his predecessor. Mr. Khan’s ministers questioned the value-for-money of power projects and whether bribes had been paid for some of the road-building—accusations angrily denied by Beijing.

谢里夫总理承诺恢复中国的“一带一路”计划，此前该计划在他的前任任内停滞不前。 汗先生的部长们质疑电力项目的性价比以及部分道路建设是否行贿——北京方面愤怒地否认了这些指控。

Pakistan’s province of Balochistan is home to the [port of Gwadar](https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-chinese-pakistani-project-tries-to-overcome-jihadists-droughts-and-doubts-1460274228?mod=article_inline), a focus of Beijing’s infrastructure program in the country. There are plans to add an airport.

巴基斯坦的俾路支省是 [瓜达尔港的](https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-chinese-pakistani-project-tries-to-overcome-jihadists-droughts-and-doubts-1460274228?mod=article_inline) 所在地，这是北京在该国基础设施项目的重点。 有计划增加一个机场。

Only three ships call a week and 28 Chinese nationals, including two chefs, live there, said Zhang Baozhong, chairman of China Overseas Port Holding Company, which runs the port, part of the state-owned [China Communications Construction](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HK/XHKG/1800) Co. Ltd.

中国海外港口控股有限公司董事长张保中说，每周只有三艘船停靠，那里住着 28 名中国公民，其中包括两名厨师。 [中国交通建设](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HK/XHKG/1800) 股份有限公司 有限公司

Locals, who don’t have sufficient electricity and drinking water, say they haven’t benefited from the port. Hidayat ur Rehman Baloch, a religious cleric whose party swept local elections this year, led a yearslong and ultimately successful push to convince authorities to drop a plan to expel residents and bulldoze part of the town for a port expansion.

没有足够电力和饮用水的当地人说，他们没有从港口受益。 Hidayat ur Rehman Baloch 是一位宗教神职人员，他所在的政党在今年的地方选举中横扫全场，他领导了长达数年的努力，最终成功说服当局放弃驱逐居民和推平该镇部分地区以扩建港口的计划。

“What does development mean?” he asked, adding that he holds the Pakistani government responsible for what he sees as the lack of local benefits from China’s investments. “We have no electricity, no healthcare available. We are thirsty.”

“发展是什么意思？” 他问道，并补充说，他认为巴基斯坦政府对他认为中国投资在当地没有带来好处的情况负有责任。 “我们没有电，也没有医疗保健。 我们渴了。”

Islamabad is hoping to entice the Chinese private sector to follow in the footsteps of state-owned firms and set up factories in the country. After the April bombing in Karachi, many Chinese entrepreneurs interested in bringing industry to Gwadar canceled their plans, said Mr. Zhang.

伊斯兰堡希望吸引中国私营部门追随国有企业的脚步，在该国设厂。 张先生说，在卡拉奇 4 月发生爆炸事件后，许多有意将工业带到瓜达尔的中国企业家取消了他们的计划。

“The effect is very negative,” the port chief said in an interview at the new U-shaped office complex he built at the port, complete with marble floors and domes. “We still believe that Pakistan is a safe place for Chinese investors, provided you follow guidelines.”

“效果非常负面，”港口负责人在他在港口建造的新 U 形办公大楼接受采访时说，该办公大楼配有大理石地板和圆顶。 “我们仍然相信，只要你遵守指导方针，巴基斯坦对中国投资者来说是一个安全的地方。”

Raffaello Pantucci, co-author of the book “Sinostan,” about China’s influence over its Muslim-majority neighboring nations, said Belt and Road was designed to help countries develop economically and lead to greater stability.

关于中国对其穆斯林占多数的邻国的影响的“Sinostan”一书的合著者 Raffaello Pantucci 说，“一带一路”旨在帮助各国发展经济并实现更大的稳定。

“The truth is, this doesn’t always resolve peoples’ anger,” Mr. Pantucci said. “Pakistan is a toxic brew for China where they have become enemy No. 1 for an array of militant groups on the ground due to their proximity to the Pakistani state.”

“事实是，这并不总能解决人们的愤怒，”潘图奇先生说。 “巴基斯坦对中国来说是一瓶有毒的啤酒，由于靠近巴基斯坦，他们已成为地面上一系列激进组织的头号敌人。”

The Baloch Liberation Army are secular insurgents who say the province’s natural resources are being exploited by the rest of the country and often target the Pakistani military. Jihadists from the Pakistani Taliban also have attacked Chinese nationals.

俾路支解放军是世俗的叛乱分子，他们说该省的自然资源正在被该国其他地区开采，并经常以巴基斯坦军队为目标。 来自巴基斯坦塔利班的圣战分子也袭击了中国公民。

Many insurgents in Pakistan see Beijing as working arm-in-arm with the government they are fighting. “President Xi, you still have time to quit,” a Baloch Liberation Army video released after the Karachi University attack warned.

巴基斯坦的许多叛乱分子认为北京与他们正在战斗的政府并肩作战。 “习主席，你还有时间退出，”卡拉奇大学袭击事件后发布的一段俾路支解放军视频发出警告。

Last year, in northern Pakistan, militants rammed an explosive-laden car into a bus carrying Chinese construction workers being taken to the site of a dam they were building. The bus was blown off a mountainside, [killing nine Chinese](https://www.wsj.com/articles/explosion-kills-at-least-nine-chinese-nationals-in-pakistan-11626255076?mod=article_inline) and four Pakistanis. This month, authorities said two men belonging to the Pakistani Taliban, a group close to al Qaeda, were sentenced to death for their role. The group hasn’t claimed the attack.

去年，在巴基斯坦北部，武装分子将一辆载有爆炸物的汽车撞向一辆载有中国建筑工人的公共汽车，这些建筑工人正被带到他们正在建造的大坝工地。 公共汽车被吹下山坡， [炸死九名中国](https://www.wsj.com/articles/explosion-kills-at-least-nine-chinese-nationals-in-pakistan-11626255076?mod=article_inline) 人和四名巴基斯坦人。 本月，当局表示，属于与基地组织关系密切的巴基斯坦塔利班的两名男子因其所扮演的角色被判处死刑。 该组织尚未对此次袭击负责。

The Pakistani Taliban also tried in 2021 to assassinate the Chinese ambassador, whose car was about two minutes away from arriving at a hotel that was bombed, Pakistani security officials say.

巴基斯坦安全官员说，巴基斯坦塔利班还试图在 2021 年暗杀中国大使，当时中国大使的汽车距离一家被炸毁的酒店只有两分钟的路程。

In Karachi, the Baloch militants have [attacked the Chinese consulate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/militants-attack-chinese-consulate-in-pakistan-1542957610?mod=article_inline) and the stock exchange, in which Chinese investors have a controlling interest.

在卡拉奇，俾路支武装分子 [袭击了中国领事馆](https://www.wsj.com/articles/militants-attack-chinese-consulate-in-pakistan-1542957610?mod=article_inline) 和中国投资者控股的证券交易所。

“Chinese confidence in our system has been shaken up,” said Mushahid Hussain, a lawmaker with close ties to Beijing, and chairman of the Senate Defense Committee. He said Pakistan has deployed enough security personnel, but needs better intelligence to prevent attacks on the Chinese.

“中国人对我们制度的信心已经动摇，”与北京关系密切的议员、参议院国防委员会主席穆沙希德侯赛因说。 他说，巴基斯坦已经部署了足够的安全人员，但需要更好的情报来防止对中国人的袭击。

Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s planning minister, said that China’s projects in the country were “not dependent on one or two odd security incidents.”

阿桑·伊克巴尔， 巴基斯坦计划部长表示，中国在该国的项目“不依赖于一两次奇怪的安全事件”。

“It reflects a broader understanding between the two countries to forge a long-term economic partnership,” Mr. Iqbal said.

“这反映了两国对建立长期经济伙伴关系的更广泛理解，”伊克巴尔先生说。

Shari Hayat, also known as Shari Baloch, was a 31-year-old with a master’s degree in zoology. Moments before she blew up the minibus, she recorded a message for her family: “Be strong. This is a hard path but we have to walk it.”

Shari Hayat，也被称为 Shari Baloch，今年 31 岁，拥有动物学硕士学位。 在她引爆小巴之前，她给家人录了一条信息：“要坚强。 这是一条艰难的道路，但我们必须走下去。”

Baloch is a common surname in the province, especially in separatist circles where it is taken to denote closeness to the struggle.

俾路支在该省是一个常见的姓氏，尤其是在分离主义圈子里，它被用来表示与斗争的密切关系。

Ms. Hayat’s family said she had no contact or grievance with the Chinese.

哈亚特女士的家人表示，她与中国人没有任何接触或恩怨。

“No one expected anything extreme from her,” said her father, Mohammad Hayat, a 74-year-old retired civil servant.

“没有人期望她会做出任何极端的事情，”她的父亲、74 岁的退休公务员穆罕默德哈亚特说。

Human-rights groups say thousands of Baloch men have been picked up by security forces as terrorist suspects under Pakistan’s crackdown on the insurgency, with many tortured or executed. Pakistani authorities acknowledge there are missing Baloch, but deny torture and extrajudicial killings.

人权组织表示，在巴基斯坦镇压叛乱活动期间，安全部队逮捕了数千名俾路支男子，将其认定为恐怖分子嫌疑人，其中许多人遭受酷刑或被处决。 巴基斯坦当局承认俾路支失踪，但否认酷刑和法外处决。

Ms. Hayat’s husband, a 32-year-old dentist named Habitan Bashir, also known as Habitan Baloch, said his wife told him two years ago that she would carry out a suicide attack. He is being sought by the Pakistani authorities for alleged involvement in the attack.

哈亚特女士的丈夫是一名 32 岁的牙医，名叫哈比坦巴希尔，也被称为哈比坦俾路支，他说他的妻子两年前告诉他，她将进行自杀式袭击。 他因涉嫌参与袭击而受到巴基斯坦当局的通缉。

She was greatly affected by the Pakistani military’s abduction of youth in the region and the anguish of their families, he said. “She took this step to show Pakistan that not only Baloch men but Baloch women are also ready to sacrifice in defense of their motherland.”

他说，巴基斯坦军方在该地区绑架青年及其家人的痛苦极大地影响了她。 “她采取这一步骤向巴基斯坦表明，不仅俾路支男子，连俾路支妇女也准备好为保卫祖国而牺牲。”
