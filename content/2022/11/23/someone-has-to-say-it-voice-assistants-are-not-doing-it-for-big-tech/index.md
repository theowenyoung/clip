Comment Black Friday is nearly upon us, but the annual online price-drop frenzy seems to be losing its shine. Numerous reports highlight that discounting may not be all it seems, and buyers would be best to shop around.

评论 黑色星期五即将来临，但一年一度的网上降价狂潮似乎正在失去光彩。 许多报道强调，折扣可能并不像看上去的那样，买家最好货比三家。

But behind the scenes, the industry is also seeing the demise of another popular craze Amazon was trying so hard to make a thing. With its voice-interface device, Alexa, the global ecommerce and tech behemoth in 2014 set in train a fashion for speech interfaces in the home, which had keen households around the world demanding their AI house guests to tell them jokes and answer trivia questions.

但在幕后，该行业也看到了亚马逊努力打造的另一种流行热潮的消亡。 凭借其语音接口设备，全球电子商务和科技巨头 Alexa 在 2014 年开创了家庭语音接口的时尚，世界各地的热衷家庭要求他们的 AI 房客给他们讲笑话并回答琐事问题。

But why? That's just what Amazon may be wondering. [According to reports](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-alexa-job-layoffs-rise-and-fall-2022-11), its Worldwide Digital unit, which Echo smart speakers and Alexa voice technology fall under, hit an operating loss of over $3 billion. Business Insider also claimed the vast majority of the losses were tied to Amazon's Alexa and other devices.

但为什么？ 这正是亚马逊可能想知道的。 [据报道](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-alexa-job-layoffs-rise-and-fall-2022-11) ，其 Echo 智能扬声器和 Alexa 语音技术所属的全球数字部门的运营亏损超过 30 亿美元。 Business Insider 还声称，绝大部分损失与亚马逊的 Alexa 和其他设备有关。

When asked by _The Register_, Amazon did not respond to this. Instead, in a statement, Amazon's senior vice president for devices and services David Limp said: "We are as committed as ever to Echo and Alexa, and will continue to invest heavily in them."

当 _The Register_ 询问时，亚马逊并未对此做出回应。 相反，亚马逊负责设备和服务的高级副总裁大卫林普在一份声明中表示：“我们一如既往地致力于 Echo 和 Alexa，并将继续对它们进行大量投资。”

Eight years after [its launch](https://www.theregister.com/2014/11/07/amazon_echo_speaker/) this is not how it was supposed to be. Alexa, along with voice-interface cousins Google Assistant and [Microsoft's Cortana](https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/01/microsofts_cortana_smartphone/), were supposed to usher in a new era of at-home interaction with information services and retail sales.

八年后， [推出](https://www.theregister.com/2014/11/07/amazon_echo_speaker/) 情况并非如此。 Alexa，连同语音界面同类产品 Google Assistant 和 [微软的 Cortana](https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/01/microsofts_cortana_smartphone/) ，本应开创一个与信息服务和零售销售在家互动的新时代。

Some estimates said the market for so-called "conversational commerce" would be worth [$35 billion by 2020](https://www.capgemini.com/no-no/service/conversational-commerce/).

，所谓的“对话商务”市场价值将 [据估计，到 2020 年](https://www.capgemini.com/no-no/service/conversational-commerce/) 达到 350 亿美元。

The argument went something like this. Offering up a combination of information and shopping, voice assistants would be able to give households guidance and advice – weather, travel, recipes etcetera – while in the background Amazon or third-party retailers use some clever analytics to serve up the most likely purchases in a given period.

争论是这样进行的。 提供信息和购物的组合，语音助手将能够为家庭提供指导和建议——天气、旅行、食谱等——而在后台，亚马逊或第三方零售商使用一些聪明的分析来提供最有可能购买的商品给定的时期。

In this slightly creepy vision of surveillance capitalism, we imagine what someone who commutes 20 miles to work on a rainy Wednesday might be wanting to cook for their school-aged kids – one of whom is lactose intolerant – when they get home. The sheer convenience and usefulness were supposed to make the services extremely sticky. Given Amazon also provides video streaming services, it was part of a so-called "digital entanglement" designed to guarantee customer loyalty.

在这种有点令人毛骨悚然的监视资本主义愿景中，我们可以想象一个在下雨的星期三通勤 20 英里上班的人可能想在回家后为他们的学龄孩子做饭——其中一个孩子患有乳糖不耐症。 纯粹的便利性和实用性本应使这些服务极具粘性。 鉴于亚马逊还提供视频流服务，它是旨在保证客户忠诚度的所谓“数字纠缠”的一部分。

What went wrong? While the tech firms behind these services did sign a number of partnerships with retailers, and [offer access to their platforms via "skills"](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries/get-ideas/features/our-brand-features/sainsburys-alexa-skill) to allow retailers take orders by voice, customers don't seem so keen.

什么地方出了错？ 虽然这些服务背后的科技公司确实与零售商签署了一些合作伙伴关系，并 [通过“技能”提供对他们平台的访问，](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries/get-ideas/features/our-brand-features/sainsburys-alexa-skill) 允许零售商通过语音接受订单，但客户似乎并不那么热衷。

From 2018 onward there was a [flurry](https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-information-only-2-of-alexa-users-reportedly-purchase-off-the-devices/529608/) of [stories](https://www.wired.com/story/why-is-voice-shopping-bad/) suggesting voice shopping was not all that it was cracked up to be and that consumers were just as happy to sit down and click away until they had the basket they wanted.

从 2018 年开始，出现了 [一连串](https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-information-only-2-of-alexa-users-reportedly-purchase-off-the-devices/529608/) 的 [故事](https://www.wired.com/story/why-is-voice-shopping-bad/) ，表明语音购物并不像宣传的那样，消费者也很乐意坐下来点击一下，直到他们得到他们想要的购物篮。

While timers, music, and weather forecasts might be good for users, they are hardly high earners for the platform providers. At the same time, the first page of Amazon "skills" downloads include four apps for making fart noises.

虽然计时器、音乐和天气预报可能对用户有好处，但它们对平台提供商来说并不是高收入。 同时，亚马逊“技能”下载的第一页包括四个用来发出放屁声音的应用程序。

Maybe it's an idea whose time is yet to come. But for now the dream of a cross-platform voice-assisted future for commerce and digital services seems set to fall silent. ®

也许这是一个尚未到来的想法。 但就目前而言，为商业和数字服务打造跨平台语音辅助未来的梦想似乎要落空了。 ®
