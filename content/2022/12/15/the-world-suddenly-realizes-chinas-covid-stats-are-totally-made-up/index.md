On the menu today: China is finally ending its draconian “Covid Zero” lockdown approach, but that raises a new set of problems — a massive population in crowded cities, with many unvaccinated elderly, and evidence suggesting that those homegrown Chinese vaccines aren’t all that effective. Is the Covid-19 pandemic that is in the rear-view mirror of much of the world about to strike with a vengeance in China? That’s going to be hard to tell, because the official Covid statistics from the Chinese government have been unbelievable nonsense propaganda from the beginning.

今天的菜单上。 中国终于结束了其严厉的 "Covid Zero "封锁办法，但这又提出了一系列新的问题--在拥挤的城市里有大量人口，有许多未接种疫苗的老人，而且有证据表明，那些中国本土的疫苗并不那么有效。 处于世界大部分地区后视镜中的Covid-19大流行病是否会在中国报复性地发作？ 这将很难说，因为中国政府的官方Covid统计数据从一开始就一直是令人难以置信的胡说八道的宣传。

The World, Regarding China: Hey, Maybe We Can’t Trust These Guys Anymore

世界，关于中国：嘿，也许我们不能再相信这些人了

[The Morning Jolt, back on December 28, 2021](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/when-will-the-rest-of-the-world-call-out-chinas-insanely-implausible-covid-19-statistics/): “When Will the Rest of the World Call Out China’s Insanely Implausible Covid-19 Statistics?”

2021年12月28日的《早间新闻》："世界其他国家何时会谴责中国令人难以置信的Covid-19统计数据？"

Apparently, it took about a year. [This morning’s _New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/business/china-economy-covid.html):  
显然，它花了大约一年的时间。 今天早上的《纽约时报》。  

> Despite those assurances, China faces much uncertainty over how the coming months will play out. Information is opaque and unreliable, which will make it difficult to gauge Beijing’s handling of the coming wave of Covid infections. The government’s desire to save face after an embarrassing retreat from its hallmark pandemic policy will only muddy the picture. . . .
> 
> 尽管有这些保证，中国在未来几个月将如何发展方面面临许多不确定性。 信息是不透明和不可靠的，这将使我们难以衡量北京对即将到来的Covid感染潮的处理。 在从其标志性的大流行病政策中尴尬地退缩后，政府希望挽回面子，这只会使情况变得更加复杂。 . . .
> 
> Some of China’s data stretches the boundaries of reason for a country with a population of 1.4 billion people. China said there had not been a single Covid-related death since it lifted pandemic restrictions six days ago. By comparison, the United States reported 469 Covid-related deaths on Tuesday alone.
> 
> 对于一个拥有14亿人口的国家来说，中国的一些数据已经超出了合理的界限。 中国说，自从六天前取消大流行限制以来，没有发生一起与Covid有关的死亡事件。 相比之下，美国仅在周二就报告了469例与Covid有关的死亡。
> 
> Since the early months of the pandemic, virologists have raised questions about China’s official mortality figures, challenging the way that the country’s hospitals classify Covid deaths. Instead of including people who died after contracting Covid-19 in official data, as is the norm in other countries, Chinese hospitals typically attribute deaths to pre-existing or chronic illnesses, such as cancer or a heart condition, they said.
> 
> 自大流行的最初几个月以来，病毒学家对中国的官方死亡数字提出了质疑，对中国医院对Covid死亡的分类方式提出质疑。 他们说，中国医院没有像其他国家那样将感染Covid-19后死亡的人纳入官方数据，而是通常将死亡归因于预先存在的或慢性疾病，如癌症或心脏病。

> Underreporting Covid cases is not unique to China, but the country is especially opaque.

> 低报Covid案件并不是中国独有的现象，但中国的情况尤其不透明。

To hear the Chinese government tell it, [its country ranks 98th in the world in total cases of Covid-19 recorded](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries), with fewer cases than Oman, Armenia, Honduras, Qatar, Estonia, Cyprus, and Kuwait. Never mind that the Chinese population of 1.4 billion is the largest in the world, the virus originated in China, and many Chinese live in close quarters in big cities where social distancing is impossible. The government’s official figure of 369,000 or so total cases is about half that of Paraguay, one-third that of Cuba, one-quarter that of Norway, one-fifth that of Slovakia, and roughly one-tenth that of Romania.

听中国政府说，其国家记录的Covid-19病例总数在世界排名第98位，比阿曼、亚美尼亚、洪都拉斯、卡塔尔、爱沙尼亚、塞浦路斯和科威特的病例少。 不要忘了中国有14亿人口，是世界上人口最多的国家，该病毒起源于中国，而且许多中国人在大城市里生活得很近，不可能有社会距离。 政府的官方数字是36.9万左右的总病例，大约是巴拉圭的一半，古巴的三分之一，挪威的四分之一，斯洛伐克的五分之一，以及罗马尼亚的大约十分之一。

Back when the U.S. was reporting more than 200,000 cases of Covid-19 per day — approaching the peak of the Omicron wave — China insisted that across the whole country, there were _nine_ cases. As I wrote back then, “Even if we want to give Chinese policies of city-wide lockdowns and [quarantining people by welding apartment doors shut](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1703503427818) the broadest possible benefit of the doubt, it’s simply not plausible that a virus that has proven wildly contagious in every other country suddenly became shy and socially-awkward once it entered the jurisdiction of the Chinese Communist Party.”

早在美国每天报告超过20万个Covid-19病例时--接近Omicron浪潮的高峰期--中国坚持认为，在整个国家，有9个病例。 正如我当时所写的，"即使我们想给中国的全城封锁和通过焊接公寓门来隔离人们的政策以最广泛的怀疑利益，也根本不可能说一种在其他所有国家都被证明具有疯狂传染性的病毒一旦进入中国共产党的管辖范围就突然变得害羞和不善于社交。

Skepticism of China’s numbers and narrative isn’t just rising now, and it isn’t just confined to the _New York Times_. But it does feel like it took a long while for that well-justified skepticism to kick in and reshape the narratives around China here in the West. [As early as February 2020](https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinas-economic-data-have-always-raised-questions-its-coronavirus-numbers-do-too-51581622840), experts looked at the country’s outbreak numbers and concluded that they didn’t add up. You may recall in April 2020 when the country’s total number of cases reported increased by precisely 50 percent — [and then remained flat for roughly two years](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/).

对中国的数字和叙述的怀疑并不是现在才开始的，也不仅仅局限于纽约时报。 但它确实感觉到，这种合理的怀疑态度花了很长时间才开始发挥作用，并重塑了西方国家对中国的叙述。 早在2020年2月，专家们审视了中国的疫情数字，并得出结论，这些数字并不相符。 你可能记得在2020年4月，该国报告的病例总数正好增加了50%--然后在大约两年内保持平稳。

This past April, the _Washington Post_ [editorial board concluded that](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/04/16/pandemic-statistics-china-are-too-good-be-true/), “The death toll reported by China in the early part of the pandemic was most likely [a very small fraction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/24/official-pandemic-death-toll-is-horrific-actual-toll-could-be-twice-that/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10) of those who actually perished. . . . Biologically, the virus in China — the omicron BA.2 subvariant — isn’t that different from elsewhere. What does make China stand apart is a government that is intent on propagating a narrative that it is doing an exceptional job in managing the pandemic.”

今年四月，《华盛顿邮报》编辑部得出结论："中国在大流行病早期报告的死亡人数很可能只是实际死亡人数的很小一部分。 . . . 在生物学上，中国的病毒 -- omicron BA.2亚变体 -- 与其他地方没有什么不同。 使中国与众不同的是政府有意宣传它在管理该大流行病方面做得很好的说法。

_The Economist_ [runs an ongoing project](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates) looking at countries’ reported death figures, comparing them to the average death rate before the pandemic, and attempting to extrapolate the excess deaths compared to “normal.” Officially China has seen just 5,235 deaths from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. _The Economist_ calculates that since the pandemic began, China has seen anywhere from 8,900 to 2.6 million more deaths than it normally would have.

经济学人》正在进行一个项目，研究各国报告的死亡数字，将其与大流行病之前的平均死亡率进行比较，并试图推断与 "正常 "相比的超额死亡。 自大流行开始以来，中国官方只看到5,235人死于Covid-19。 经济学人》计算出，自该大流行病开始以来，中国的死亡人数比正常情况下多出8900至260万。

One other aspect of the Chinese government’s denial is an [overestimation of the effectiveness of its homegrown vaccines](https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/who-squanders-cash-on-shoddy-chinese-vaccines/). Those vaccines just don’t work as well as the ones developed in the U.S., Europe, and [hey, go figure, even Russia](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/when-even-russia-is-beating-you-in-the-race-to-an-effective-vaccine/). China says that 90 percent of its population is vaccinated, but somehow, when trying to mitigate a virus that is most deadly to the elderly, the Chinese government has failed to [vaccinate the elderly](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/12/09/1140830315/why-vaccine-hesitancy-persists-in-china-and-what-theyre-doing-about-it): “The government [announced](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/gzzcwj/202211/9bb71c9c7d664fb0bbcd2b3eaaefcf84.shtml) a little over a week ago that around 30 percent of people aged 60 and up — or roughly 80 million people — were not vaccinated and boosted as of Nov. 11. Among those 80 or older, the ratio was closer to 60 percent.” (Considering the far-reaching power of the Chinese government to compel its citizens to obey orders, you can be forgiven for wondering if the failure to vaccinate the most elderly is entirely accidental.)

中国政府否认的另一个方面是高估了其国产疫苗的有效性。 这些疫苗没有美国、欧洲，以及嘿，去想，甚至俄罗斯开发的疫苗那么好用。 中国说其90%的人口都接种了疫苗，但不知何故，当试图减轻一种对老年人最致命的病毒时，中国政府却没有为老年人接种疫苗。 "政府在一个多星期前宣布，截至11月11日，约有30%的60岁及以上的人--或者说约有8000万人--没有接种疫苗和加强免疫。 在80岁或以上的人中，这一比例接近60%"。 (考虑到中国政府强迫其公民服从命令的深远权力，你可以理解为怀疑没有为最年长的人接种疫苗是否完全是偶然的）。

In fact, [the Chinese government vaccinated citizens ages 18 to 59 before](https://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/doi/10.46234/ccdcw2022.173#:~:text=China%20began%20opening%20COVID%2D19,for%20free%20regardless%20of%20residency.) it vaccinated those 60 and older. This fueled the perception among some Chinese that the vaccine wasn’t safe for the elderly.

事实上，中国政府在为60岁及以上的人接种疫苗之前，先为18至59岁的公民接种疫苗。 这助长了一些中国人的看法，即疫苗对老年人并不安全。

[NPR lays out](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/12/09/1140830315/why-vaccine-hesitancy-persists-in-china-and-what-theyre-doing-about-it) how some Chinese are hesitant to get shots of homegrown vaccines because of “product quality issues that have for years plagued manufacturing in China — including its production of pharmaceuticals. . . . Lax oversight and corruption during recent decades of breakneck economic growth has led to a string of product quality scandals in China — from baby formula cut with industrial [chemicals](https://www.npr.org/2008/09/18/94748565/milk-powder-scandal-angers-chinese-parents) to [contaminated](https://www.npr.org/2008/03/06/87961819/contaminant-suspected-in-heparin-deaths) blood thinner and [tainted](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/world/asia/china-vaccines-scandal-investigation.html) vaccines.” Sometimes, you open a package of something made in China, like a new iPhone, and it works, right out of the box. Sometimes, you order a toy or kid’s bicycle and there are parts missing, extra parts, or the instructions are poorly written, and you can tell no one’s paying close attention to the products going out the door. Who wants to apply that hit-and-miss professionalism to something that’s put into your bloodstream?

NPR指出，一些中国人对注射国产疫苗感到犹豫，因为 "产品质量问题多年来一直困扰着中国的制造业--包括其药品生产。 . . . 在最近几十年的高速经济增长中，监督不严和腐败导致中国出现一连串的产品质量丑闻--从使用工业化学品的婴儿配方奶粉到被污染的血液稀释剂和有毒疫苗。 有时，你打开一个中国制造的东西的包装，比如一个新的iPhone，它可以使用，开箱即用。 有时，你订购了一个玩具或儿童自行车，但有零件丢失，有多余的零件，或者说明书写得很差，你可以看出没有人密切关注即将出厂的产品。 谁想把这种一击即中的专业精神运用到放入你血液中的东西上？

This is the kind of uncomfortable subject some may prefer to avoid, lest they be accused of some sort of xenophobia. But the quality-control problems that plague Chinese manufacturers won’t go away if you pretend they don’t exist. [Chinese citizens know which vaccines they trust](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Chinese-mainlanders-rush-to-Macao-for-mRNA-vaccinations):

这是一些人可能宁愿避免的不舒服的话题，以免他们被指责为某种仇外心理。 但如果你假装它们不存在，困扰中国制造商的质量控制问题也不会消失。 中国公民知道他们信任哪些疫苗。

Now, China has finally — finally — recognized that an endless series of intermittent lockdowns in the name of “Covid Zero” is unsustainable. But this means allowing the Chinese people to live their lives, not well vaccinated, with an extremely contagious virus floating around, with a whole bunch of unvaccinated elderly. [Nobody knows exactly how this will shake out, but it won’t be good](https://www.science.org/content/article/models-predict-massive-wave-disease-and-death-if-china-lifts-zero-covid-policy):

现在，中国终于--终于--认识到，以 "Covid Zero "的名义进行的一系列无休止的间歇性封锁是不可持续的。 但这意味着允许中国人民在没有很好地接种疫苗的情况下生活，周围漂浮着一种极具传染性的病毒，还有一大堆没有接种疫苗的老人。 没有人知道这到底会怎样，但它不会是好事。

> A study based on vaccination rates in March, published in _Nature Medicine_ in May, [found that lifting zero-COVID restrictions at that point](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01855-7) could “generate a tsunami of COVID-19 cases” over a 6-month period, with 112 million symptomatic cases, 2.7 million intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and 1.6 million deaths. Peak demand for ICU beds would hit 1 million, more than 15 times the current capacity.
> 
> 5月发表在《自然医学》上的一项基于3月份疫苗接种率的研究发现，届时取消零COVID限制可能会在6个月内 "产生COVID-19病例的海啸"，出现1.12亿个有症状的病例，270万例重症监护室（ICU）住院，160万人死亡。 对ICU床位的高峰需求将达到100万张，是目前容量的15倍以上。

There’s an interesting parallel between China’s unreliable health data and the country’s unreliable economic data. Year by year, China has released less and less economic data — by 2016, more than [half of all indicators published by the national and municipal statistics bureaus in 2012 had been quietly discontinued](https://www.ft.com/content/43bea201-ff6c-4d94-8506-e58ff787802c), according to the _Financial Times_’ John Burn Murdoch. It’s a safe assumption that if the figures showed good news, the Chinese government would be bragging about them.

中国不可靠的健康数据和该国不可靠的经济数据之间有一个有趣的平行。 根据《金融时报》记者John Burn Murdoch的报道，中国发布的经济数据一年比一年少--到2016年，国家和市级统计局在2012年发布的所有指标中，有一半以上已经悄悄停用了。 一个安全的假设是，如果数据显示出好消息，中国政府就会对其进行吹嘘。

[Earlier this year](https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/qa-luis-martinez-exposes-way-dictators-exaggerate-economic-performance), Luis Martinez, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago, examined the light from countries from satellite photos, year by year, and used that as a measuring stick of economic development. (More economic growth means more buildings, and more buildings means more light at night.) His research indicated that, “Autocracies overstate their yearly GDP growth by approximately 35 percent.” Maybe China’s exaggerations are a little less, maybe they’re a little more. But the implications of this longstanding embellishment of economic power are extremely consequential for geopolitical perceptions. Maybe China isn’t the rising superpower — about to overtake the U.S. — that so many inside and outside of China have claimed for years. Maybe it’s a lot of smoke and mirrors, hiding a system that is a lot more inflexible, rickety, and slipshod than any Chinese leader was ever willing to admit. (If the Chinese economy is a lot weaker than it looks, held aloft by hype . . . well, that’s [just one more example of the _Fortune_ magazine cover jinx](https://coverjunkie.com/cover-categories/best-of-the-rest/fortune-india-12/).)

今年早些时候，芝加哥大学的助理教授路易斯-马丁内斯（Luis Martinez）从卫星照片中逐年研究了各国的光线，并将其作为经济发展的衡量标准。 (更多的经济增长意味着更多的建筑，而更多的建筑意味着更多的夜间光线）。 他的研究表明，"专制国家将其每年的GDP增长夸大了大约35%"。 也许中国的夸大有点少，也许是有点多。 但这种长期以来对经济实力的美化对地缘政治认知的影响是极其重要的。 也许中国并不是一个正在崛起的超级大国--即将超越美国--多年来中国内外许多人声称的那样。 也许这只是大量的烟雾和镜子，掩盖了一个比任何中国领导人愿意承认的更不灵活、更摇晃、更粗疏的系统。 (如果中国经济比它看起来要弱得多，被炒作得高高在上......好吧，这只是《财富》杂志封面厄运的另一个例子）。

Surely we all remember the [old 1980s anti-drug public-service announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FtNm9CgA6U), “This is your drugs . . . this is your brain on drugs . . . any questions?” Well, autocracies fry your brain, too. They make the entire country turn itself inside out to cater to the arbitrary whims of one man — whether that man is Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, or Kim Jong-un. Once the leader makes a decision, everyone has to pretend it was the right decision, no matter how much the evidence piles up that it was a terrible mistake. China can’t admit that other countries’ vaccines work more effectively, and it certainly can’t be seen asking for help. Better that _millions of people die_ than Xi Jinping admit that the West has a better solution to anything, much less a problem as serious as Covid-19. This is the same mentality that [had the Chinese government insisting that Covid-19 was not contagious for the first month or so](https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/chinas-devastating-lies/) of the outbreak.

我们肯定都记得20世纪80年代的反毒品公益广告，"这是你的毒品......这是你的大脑在吸毒......有问题吗？" 那么，专制国家也会煎熬你的大脑。 他们让整个国家把自己翻个底朝天，以迎合一个人的任意妄想--无论这个人是习近平、弗拉基米尔-普京，还是金正恩。 一旦领导人做出决定，每个人都必须假装这是一个正确的决定，不管有多少证据表明这是一个可怕的错误。 中国不能承认其他国家的疫苗更有效，当然也不能让人看到它在寻求帮助。 宁可让数百万人死去，也不能让习近平承认西方对任何事情都有更好的解决办法，更不用说像Covid-19这样严重的问题。 正是这种心态，让中国政府在疫情爆发的头一个月左右坚持认为Covid-19没有传染性。

It would be easier to ignore the problems of autocracies if their problems stayed within their own borders. But as we saw with Covid, they don’t. And in the case of Russia, autocrats periodically want to redraw their borders through military force.

如果专制国家的问题停留在他们自己的边界内，那么忽视他们的问题会更容易。 但正如我们在科维德身上看到的，他们不会这样做。 在俄罗斯的情况下，专制者定期想通过军事力量重新划定他们的边界。

**ADDENDUM:** Donald Trump is such a malleable, ever-changing, self-contradictory figure that a commenter can [respond to yesterday’s Corner post by declaring](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/hows-that-early-announcement-working-out-for-trump-so-far/), “You missed it, Jim. Trump has no intention of running, as I and many others have been saying for well over a year.” On the face of it, it’s absurd to contend that a declared candidate for president has no intention of running for president.

附加说明。 唐纳德-特朗普是这样一个可塑性强、不断变化、自相矛盾的人物，以至于有评论者可以通过宣称 "你错过了，吉姆 "来回应昨天的《角落》一文。 特朗普无意参选，我和许多其他人已经说了一年多了。" 从表面上看，认为一个已宣布的总统候选人无意参选的说法是荒谬的。

And yet . . . Trump’s actions since he announced his third bid for the White House have been so self-destructive — dining with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes, [calling for the Constitution to be terminated and for himself to be reinstated as president](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/john-bolton-calls-out-2024-contenders-for-not-aggressively-confronting-trump/), [complaining that Jewish leaders haven’t been loyal enough to him](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-claims-jewish-leaders-lack-loyalty-amid-backlash-over-his-dinner-with-fuentes-and-ye/) — that it doesn’t seem all that crazy to wonder if Trump really wants to win the nomination and presidency again. We know he has advisers who are telling him to stay away from Kanye West and so on. No one’s telling him that the best way to spend his time is to share memes on Truth Social and raging against other Republicans such as Ron DeSantis and Glenn Youngkin. Even Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have declared that they don’t want to be involved in a Trump campaign in 2024.

然而......。 特朗普自宣布第三次竞选白宫以来，他的行为是如此自我毁灭--与坎耶-韦斯特和尼克-富恩特斯共进晚餐，呼吁终止宪法并恢复自己的总统身份，抱怨犹太领导人对他不够忠诚--以至于怀疑特朗普是否真的想再次赢得提名和总统职位似乎并不那么疯狂。 我们知道他的顾问告诉他要远离坎耶-韦斯特等等。 没有人告诉他，打发时间的最佳方式是在Truth Social上分享备忘录，并怒斥其他共和党人，如罗恩-德桑蒂斯和格伦-杨金。 甚至贾里德-库什纳和伊万卡-特朗普也宣布，他们不想参与2024年的特朗普竞选。

Maybe this commenter is right in a way — some part of Trump doesn’t want to be president again, and that part is driving him to take the most counterproductive, alienating, self-sabotaging actions imaginable.
