## 冯远说中国女性的愤怒是改变的力量

## The government is worried about too much activism

## 政府担心激进主义过多

CHINESE WOMEN are angry about many things and are increasingly daring to express their anger. Two of the most widely shared stories on Chinese social media in 2022 involved them. One was about a woman found chained in a shed, who had been trafficked and abused, and had given birth to eight children. The other was about a man who, with eight of his friends, beat four women for refusing their sexual advances in a restaurant in the northern city of Tangshan. Though these cases were unusual, they symbolise the violence and mistreatment that women still suffer in China.

中国 女性 对很多事情感到愤怒，并且越来越敢于表达自己的愤怒。 2022 年中国社交媒体上分享最广泛的两个故事都涉及到他们。 一个是关于一个女人被发现被锁在一个棚子里，被拐卖和虐待，并生了八个孩子。 另一个是关于一个男人和他的八个朋友在北方城市唐山的一家餐馆里殴打四名拒绝性骚扰的女人。 尽管这些案例很不寻常，但它们象征着女性在中国仍然遭受的暴力和虐待。

Chinese women have long been told that they are equal with men, and used to feel relatively safe. But now this feeling is fading. They are angry not only about the physical violence against them, but also about the way the authorities respond to such incidents. Officials may eventually act against the perpetrators but only after huge public outcries. They do little to support women’s daily rights on the ground. Women’s social-media accounts may vanish at any time. Activists may be visited, if not detained, by police for simply posting or re-posting some “sensitive words” about what is happening to them. So Chinese women go into 2023 asking many questions.

长期以来，中国女性一直被告知她们与男性平等，并且习惯于感到相对安全。 但现在这种感觉正在消退。 他们不仅对针对他们的身体暴力感到愤怒，而且对当局应对此类事件的方式感到愤怒。 官员最终可能会对肇事者采取行动，但只有在公众强烈抗议之后才会这样做。 他们几乎没有在实地支持妇女的日常权利。 女性的社交媒体账户随时可能消失。 活动人士即使没有被拘留，也可能会因为仅仅张贴或重新张贴一些关于发生在他们身上的事情的“敏感词”而被警察访问。 所以中国女性在进入 2023 年时提出了很多问题。

Will their anger be addressed in the coming year? Perhaps partly, because officials are making encouraging noises. Protecting women’s rights was touched on at the recent Communist Party congress. However, the authorities’ goal is stability and they will say whatever it takes to maintain it. The point is that women are demanding more than that. They demand action. Young women, especially, are more and more aware of their rights, and they are very upset that their needs and rights are being sidelined.

他们的愤怒会在来年得到解决吗？ 也许部分是因为官员们正在发出鼓舞人心的声音。 保护妇女权利在最近的共产党代表大会上被提及。 然而，当局的目标是稳定，他们会不惜一切代价维持稳定。 关键是女性的要求远不止于此。 他们要求采取行动。 尤其是年轻女性，越来越意识到自己的权利，她们对自己的需求和权利被边缘化感到非常不安。

The government says it wants us to be equal, but when we publicly demand it, they shut us down

政府说它希望我们平等，但当我们公开要求时，他们却让我们停摆

The pandemic has not helped. Fully 90% of the 10,000 respondents to a survey of women in October 2020 expressed dissatisfaction with their treatment. They focused on the impact of marriage and childbirth on their careers, the lack of equal work opportunities and the lack of autonomy in marriage decisions. They also spoke of insufficient opportunities in education and inadequate measures against domestic violence and sexual harassment.

大流行病没有帮助。 在 2020 年 10 月的一项女性调查中，10,000 名受访者中有整整 90% 对她们的待遇表示不满。 他们关注婚姻和生育对职业的影响、缺乏平等的工作机会以及婚姻决策缺乏自主权。 他们还谈到教育机会不足以及针对家庭暴力和性骚扰的措施不足。

In 2023 China will bring in a revised law on the protection of women’s rights. The revisions are a big improvement, but the law still does not come close to fulfilling China’s commitment to the terms of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), to which the country is a signatory.

2023年，中国将出台修订后的妇女权益保障法。 修订是一项重大改进，但法律仍未接近履行中国对《消除对妇女歧视公约》（ CEDAW ）条款的承诺，该国是该国的签署国。

For instance, the revised law does not define discrimination against women in a comprehensive manner, nor bring in enough accountability for those who abuse women’s rights. It also lacks concrete measures regarding punishment for officials and public institutions who abuse their power towards women.

例如，修订后的法律没有全面界定对妇女的歧视，也没有对侵犯妇女权利的人进行足够的问责。 对于对妇女滥用职权的官员和公共机构，它也缺乏具体的惩罚措施。

Will women feel safer in 2023? This is unlikely. On the one hand, women are more willing to seek help now. However, we are getting more hate speech and misogynistic pushback from Chinese men who accuse us of creating confrontation between the sexes, demanding a superior status over them and being manipulated by hostile foreign forces.

女性在 2023 年会感到更安全吗？ 这不太可能。 一方面，女性现在更愿意寻求帮助。 然而，我们越来越多地收到来自中国男性的仇恨言论和厌恶女性的抵制，他们指责我们在两性之间制造对抗，要求高于他们的地位，并被敌对的外国势力所操纵。

In the middle of the night recently, I received a threatening phone call from an anonymous man. Women’s rights advocates increasingly receive this kind of abuse. We have been working in fear since 2015, when five young feminists were detained for planning a campaign for International Women’s Day against sexual harassment on public transport. The government insists that we are equal with men, but when we publicly demand that equality, they shut us down.

最近半夜，我接到一个匿名男子的恐吓电话。 妇女权利倡导者越来越多地受到这种虐待。 自 2015 年以来，我们一直在恐惧中工作，当时五名年轻的女权主义者因策划国际妇女节反对公共交通性骚扰的运动而被拘留。 政府坚持我们与男人平等，但当我们公开要求平等时，他们却让我们停了下来。

China will have new representatives in the National People’s Congress and new senior government officials in March 2023. Can women expect these leaders to address their concerns with more than just window-dressing? It is unlikely. There is not a single woman in the new party leadership revealed in October, even while 21% of government ministers worldwide are women.

2023 年 3 月，中国将迎来新的全国人大代表和新的政府高级官员。女性能否指望这些领导人解决她们的担忧，而不仅仅是装点门面？ 不太可能。 10 月份公布的新党领导层中没有一名女性，尽管全球 21% 的政府部长是女性。

Chinese women believe that no country can have a bright future if its women are oppressed. And the government realises this. Look at its anxiety at the declining birth rate, as more women decide not to marry and have children. Now is a perfect opportunity for the new party leaders to initiate real change, to enable women’s participation in policymaking and public life, and to make sure our voices are actually heard. Nothing about us without us.■

中国妇女认为，如果妇女受到压迫，任何国家都不会有光明的未来。 政府意识到了这一点。 看看它对生育率下降的焦虑，因为越来越多的女性决定不结婚不生孩子。 现在是新党领导人发起真正变革、让妇女参与决策和公共生活、确保我们的声音真正被听到的绝佳机会。 没有我们就没有我们。 ■
