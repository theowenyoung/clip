You’re reading The Morning newsletter.  Make sense of the day’s news and ideas. David Leonhardt and Times journalists guide you through what’s happening — and why it matters.

When a man hung two protest banners on a highway crossover in central Beijing in mid-October, it was clear he had pulled off a shockingly brave act in Xi Jinping’s China. But most expected it to be forgotten once the censors [scrubbed](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/14/world/asia/china-internet-protest-xi-jinping.html?_ga=2.243540493.922154295.1670131104-711096141.1592804144) the internet in China of any explicit mentions of his action.

10 月中旬，当一名男子在北京市中心的一个高速公路立交桥上悬挂两条抗议横幅时，很明显，他在习近平的中国完成了一项令人震惊的勇敢行为。 但大多数人预计，一旦审查 [人员清除](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/14/world/asia/china-internet-protest-xi-jinping.html?_ga=2.243540493.922154295.1670131104-711096141.1592804144) 了中国互联网上任何明确提及他的行为的内容，它就会被遗忘。

Yet less than two months later, his slogans have become rallying cries in cities and campuses across China and the world as the Chinese public has [protested](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/world/asia/china-covid-protests-xi-jinping.html) the government’s harsh Covid restrictions and deprivation of their rights.

然而不到两个月后，随着中国公众 [抗议](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/world/asia/china-covid-protests-xi-jinping.html) 政府严厉的 Covid 限制和剥夺他们的权利，他的口号已成为中国乃至世界各地城市和校园的集会号召。

“We want food, not Covid tests,” protesters chanted, reciting the banners’ slogans. “We want reform, not Cultural Revolution. We want freedom, not lockdowns. We want votes, not a ruler. We want dignity, not lies. We are citizens, not slaves.” In Shanghai, some even shouted the banners’ most radical demand: “Remove the despotic traitor Xi Jinping!”

“我们想要食物，而不是 Covid 测试，”抗议者高呼口号，背诵横幅的口号。 “我们要改革，不是文化大革命。 我们想要自由，而不是封锁。 我们要选票，而不是统治者。 我们要的是尊严，而不是谎言。 我们是公民，不是奴隶。” 在上海，甚至有人喊出了最激进的条幅要求：“除掉习近平这个卖国贼！”

Now the man who posted the banners, Peng Lifa, is called “the man who lighted the spark in darkness,” “the lone warrior” and the “Bridge Man,” a reference to the “Tank Man” who stood in front of a line of tanks in 1989 during Beijing’s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Peng is widely considered the person who inspired many people to participate in the recent protests, the biggest in China since then.

现在张贴横幅的彭利发被称为“在黑暗中点亮火花的人”、“孤独的战士”和“桥人”，指的是站在路边的“坦克人”。 1989 年北京在天安门广场血腥镇压亲民主示威者时，一排坦克。 彭被广泛认为是激励许多人参加最近抗议活动的人，这是中国自那时以来规模最大的抗议活动。

We know little about Peng. The authorities took him from the bridge and into custody, and his whereabouts remains unknown. The Chinese government never acknowledged him. He has simply disappeared from the public view.

我们对彭知之甚少。 当局将他从桥上带走并拘留，至今下落不明。 中国政府从未承认过他。 他只是从公众视野中消失了。

“He’s a prophet-like figure,” said Pu Zhiqiang, a human rights lawyer based in Beijing who was disbarred because of his own advocacy.

“他是一个先知般的人物，”因自己的倡导而被取消执业资格的北京人权律师浦志强说。

“The lone warrior,” a Twitter account with the handle @zengamy wrote to Peng, “no matter where you are, please take a look at this: your voice has spread all over our country, our own China.”

“孤独的战士，”一个名为@zengamy 的推特账号给彭写道，“无论你身在何处，请看看这个：你的声音已经传遍了我们的祖国，传遍了我们自己的中国。”

Today, I will explain how with one simple, yet brave act, Peng shaped the biggest protests in China in a generation.

今天，我将解释彭如何通过一个简单而勇敢的举动，在中国掀起了一代人以来最大规模的抗议活动。

## Behind the banners

## 横幅的背后

In videos and images of the banners being hung, a person in an orange top and a yellow hard hat is seen fastening them to the side of the bridge while a column of smoke rises nearby, probably an attempt to draw the attention of pedestrians and drivers passing the busy intersection. A loudspeaker repeats the slogans that urged the public to fight for food, freedom, the right to vote and to remove Xi.

在悬挂横幅的视频和图像中，可以看到一个身穿橙色上衣、头戴黄色安全帽的人将横幅固定在桥的一侧，附近升起一团烟雾，这可能是为了引起行人和司机的注意经过繁忙的十字路口。 一个扩音器重复着敦促公众为食物、自由、选举权和罢免习近平而战的口号。

In two Twitter accounts believed to be owned by Peng, he claims to be a physics and philosophy enthusiast. Based on business registration information, he appears to be a shareholder in a small tech company in Beijing. In a 23-page manifesto that he posted on an academic website hours before his action, he wrote that China should be free and democratic. He urged the Chinese public to try to stop Xi from securing a norm-breaking third term as China’s top leader, which Xi did a few days later at a highly choreographed party congress.

在据信由彭拥有的两个推特账户中，他声称自己是一名物理学和哲学爱好者。 根据工商登记信息，他似乎是北京一家小型科技公司的股东。 在他行动前几个小时发布在学术网站上的一份 23 页的宣言中，他写道中国应该是自由和民主的。 他敦促中国公众努力阻止习近平获得打破常规的第三个中国最高领导人任期，几天后，习近平在精心策划的党代会上做到了这一点。

Peng is believed to be 48 and was born in Heilongjiang Province, which borders Russia to the north.

彭据信现年 48 岁，出生于北邻俄罗斯的黑龙江省。

The world knows little about what will happen to him. Xi’s critics have been punished severely. [Ren Zhiqiang](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/world/asia/china-ren-zhiqiang-tycoon.html), a retired real estate mogul, wrote an essay critical of the Chinese government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020. He called Xi a “clown.” Now Ren is serving an 18-year sentence. [Xu Zhiyong](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/08/world/asia/china-rights-defense-activists.html), a prominent activist, wrote an open letter in 2020 calling on Xi to step down. He was arrested, then tried in secret for subversion in June. The court’s verdict remains unknown.

世人对他会发生什么一无所知。 习近平的批评者受到了严厉的惩罚。 [退休的房地产大亨任志强](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/world/asia/china-ren-zhiqiang-tycoon.html) 在 2020 年初写了一篇文章批评中国政府对冠状病毒爆发的反应。他称习近平是“小丑”。 现在，任正在服刑 18 年。 [著名活动家许志永](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/08/world/asia/china-rights-defense-activists.html) 在 2020 年写了一封公开信，呼吁习近平下台。 他被捕，然后在 6 月以颠覆罪被秘密审判。 法院的判决仍然未知。

Peng went a step further by staging a political protest on the street, an extremely rare and risky act in China.

彭更进一步，在街头举行政治抗议，这在中国是极为罕见和冒险的行为。

## Amplifying the message

## 放大信息

Many protesters I interviewed said that Peng had inspired them. “He showed us that you could say these things even in China,” Xia, a college graduate, said of his political slogans. She was detained for 24 hours after participating in a protest in Shanghai in late November. She wanted to be identified only by her family name out of safety concerns.

我采访过的许多抗议者都说彭给了他们启发。 “他向我们展示了即使在中国也可以说这些话，”大学毕业生夏谈到他的政治口号时说。 她在 11 月下旬参加上海的抗议活动后被拘留了 24 小时。 出于安全考虑，她希望只公开她的姓氏。

Chinese pro-democracy activists running the Instagram account [Citizens Daily CN](https://www.instagram.com/citizensdailycn/) said they took the risks to organize protests around the world because they wanted to continue what Peng started.

的中国亲民主活动人士 [经营 Instagram 账号Citizens Daily CN](https://www.instagram.com/citizensdailycn/) 表示，他们冒着风险在世界各地组织抗议活动，因为他们想延续彭开始的事业。

His demands cover a variety of issues: daily needs, opposition to the “zero Covid” policy and opposition to dictatorship, a representative of the group said. “They quickly became consensus among Chinese dissidents and protesters.”

该组织的一位代表说，他的要求涵盖了各种问题：日常需求、反对“零 Covid”政策和反对独裁统治。 “他们很快成为中国持不同政见者和抗议者的共识。”

Some of the actors featured in [this year’s edition of the Great Performers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/06/magazine/best-actors-2022.html), from The New York Times Magazine, are stars who seemed to reach a new peak in 2022 — **Michelle Yeoh** in “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” **Keke Palmer** and **Daniel Kaluuya** in “Nope.”

The list also includes breakout performances. In “The Woman King,” **Thuso Mbedu** gets to be “teary, tough, terse and sometimes, in her steeliness, a riot.” The rapper **Freddie Gibbs**’s film debut in “Down With the King” is nuanced and authentic. And **Frankie Corio**, the adolescent star of “Aftersun,” plays “a happy child, in one of the saddest movies you’ll ever see.”
