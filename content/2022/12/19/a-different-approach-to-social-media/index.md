## The Problem With The Feed  
Feed的问题#  

Social media platforms have traditionally been designed around the concept of a “feed”. This feed is typically organized chronologically, with the most recent content appearing at the top. The focus on the feed has led to an emphasis on frequent posting and engagement, as well as the use of algorithms to determine which content is shown to each user. The feeds were somewhat okay until it was showing updates from friends or family but now we all know feeds are more than that. Our feeds nowadays involve updates from brands, organizations, causes we care about and whole lot of other things including ads. This leads to missing content or updates that we actually care about. The feed can also result into information overload. Almost every platform uses feed as a medium to maximize engagement with platform. While at the same time they have no regard for users time.

传统上，社交媒体平台都是围绕“提要”这一概念设计的。此提要通常按时间顺序组织，最新的内容显示在顶部。对提要的关注导致了对频繁发布和参与的重视，以及使用算法来确定向每个用户显示哪些内容。在显示来自朋友或家人的更新之前，这些提要还算不错，但现在我们都知道提要不止这些。我们现在的订阅源包括来自品牌、组织、我们关心的事业以及包括广告在内的许多其他事情的更新。这会导致我们真正关心的内容或更新丢失。提要也可能导致信息过载。几乎每个平台都使用Feed作为媒介，以最大限度地提高与平台的参与度。同时，他们也不考虑用户的时间。

## We Can Do Better  
我们可以做得更好#  

Imagine this, you open your social media app and you are presented with a list or a grid of avatars of your friends and family. Once you click avatar of someone you are presented with below options

想象一下，你打开你的社交媒体应用，你会看到一份列表或一张你朋友和家人的头像网格。一旦你点击某人的头像，你就会看到下面的选项

-   Blog 博客
-   Gallery 美术馆
-   Stories/Highlights  
    故事/亮点  
    
-   Pins (anything that user wants to share with visitor)  
    Pins(用户想要与访问者共享的任何内容)  
    
-   User defined or anything else  
    用户定义或任何其他内容  
    

Now this app supports which option to open by default on clicking avatar, so if you are interested only in stories of your friends and family then clicking those avatars will directly take you to user stories. Also you have option to pin few people so that those people always show up on top of your grid. I think the advantages with this approach are quite obvious but let me list them anyway.

现在这款应用支持在点击头像时默认打开哪个选项，所以如果你只对你的朋友和家人的故事感兴趣，那么点击这些头像会直接把你带到用户故事。此外，您还可以选择固定几个人，以便这些人始终显示在您的网格顶部。我认为这种方法的优势是相当明显的，但不管怎样，让我列出它们。

1.  **Saves time**: Unlike feed, here you choose what updates you want to view. Infinite scrolling is a trap to keep the user captive with the portal and increase engagement.
    
    节省时间：与提要不同，您可以在这里选择要查看的更新。无限滚动是一种陷阱，目的是让用户受制于门户并增加参与度。
    
2.  **Discourages app use**: Unlike existing social media paltforms that find ways to keep you engage with their app, this design discourages use of app. After some time, people will just leave the app because going back and forth is harder than scrolling the page for miles.
    
    不鼓励使用应用程序：与现有的社交媒体平台会想方设法让你保持与应用程序的互动不同，这种设计不鼓励使用应用程序。一段时间后，人们就会离开这款应用，因为来回滚动页面比滚动几英里远的页面更难。
    
3.  **You never miss updates**: Updates from people just sit there until you open them. You can view user profiles and their content at your convenience and hence never miss updates.
    
    你永远不会错过更新：人们的更新只是停留在那里，直到你打开他们。您可以在方便的时候查看用户配置文件及其内容，因此不会错过更新。
    
4.  **Encourages interaction with others**: If you want to know someone better you just open their profile and you have everything from their likes to blogs and stories at one place. The user is more likely to engage with selected profile when all their content is in one place.
    
    鼓励与他人互动：如果你想更好地了解某人，只需打开他们的个人资料，你就可以在一个地方获得从他们的喜欢到博客和故事的一切。当用户的所有内容都在一个地方时，用户更有可能使用所选的配置文件。
    
5.  **Reduction in noise**: With feeds, people interact with the content in real time and this is more likely to cause debates and more engagement which is good for the platform but not the user. If people want to have discussions then they should use forums or reddit not a social media app. Our app by its design strongly discourages real time interactions on the content and hence less noise.
    
    减少噪音：有了Feed，人们可以与内容实时互动，这更有可能引发辩论和更多的参与，这对平台有利，但对用户不利。如果人们想要进行讨论，那么他们应该使用论坛或Reddit，而不是社交媒体应用。我们的应用程序在设计上强烈反对在内容上进行实时交互，因此噪音较小。
    

I think this kind of user centric design of apps and services is need of time. Here is a [trading platform](https://zerodha.tech/blog/user-disengagement/) that actually focusses on user centric design and they have been highly succesful in their field. I think we need to do something similar in social media space and in other fields too. The obvious diadvantage of such a platform is that the growth is not astronomical. So yes, the possibility that no one is going to build this kind of social media platform is very real!

我认为这种以用户为中心的应用和服务设计是需要时间的。这是一个真正专注于以用户为中心的设计的交易平台，他们在各自的领域取得了很大的成功。我认为我们需要在社交媒体领域和其他领域做一些类似的事情。这样一个平台的明显劣势是，增长并不是天文数字。所以，是的，没有人会建立这样的社交媒体平台的可能性是非常真实的！
