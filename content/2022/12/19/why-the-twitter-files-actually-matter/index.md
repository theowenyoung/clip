  original_title: Why the Twitter Files actually matter
  original_lang: en

Big surprise: The Twitter Files — the reports based on internal Twitter documents and messages that the company’s new owner Elon Musk provided to journalists — have landed as a polarizing salvo in the culture war.

最令人惊讶的是：Twitter文件--基于公司新东家埃隆·马斯克提供给记者的Twitter内部文件和消息的报道--在文化战争中引发了两极分化的攻击。

Many inclined to distrust what they see as Big Tech’s liberal leanings have cried vindication. The documents show in detail how Twitter made key content moderation decisions that disadvantaged Trump, conservatives, and people who broke with the public health consensus on Covid-19. They say the evidence proves that, again and again, Twitter intervened to squelch speech that the liberal establishment didn’t like.

许多人倾向于不相信他们认为的科技巨头的自由主义倾向，并呼吁证明自己是正确的。这些文件详细显示了推特是如何做出关键的内容审查决定的，这些决定对特朗普、保守派和那些在新冠肺炎上违反公共卫生共识的人不利。他们说，证据证明，Twitter一次又一次地干预，压制了自由派建制派不喜欢的言论。

Meanwhile, others — including most liberals and many mainstream journalists — are unimpressed. They say Twitter’s policies here were already known and that the specific decisions in question — blocking a story they feared stemmed from a foreign hack, banning the account of President Trump after he incited an insurrection, and deboosting accounts spreading public health misinformation — generally seem at least defensible.

与此同时，其他人--包括大多数自由派人士和许多主流记者--对此不以为然。他们说，Twitter在这里的政策已经为人所知，相关的具体决定--屏蔽他们担心来自外国黑客的报道，在特朗普总统煽动叛乱后禁止他的账户，以及取消传播公共卫生错误信息的账户--通常看起来至少是合理的。

So liberals have been inclined to view anything they say with deep skepticism, an instinct that was seemingly vindicated quickly after Taibbi posted his first report. He [spotlighted an email](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598827602403160064) stating that in October 2020 the Biden campaign had sent along requests to delete certain tweets, writing that an executive responded: “Handled.” Musk [responded to](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1598850682487943168) this revelation with outrage: “If this isn’t a violation of the Constitution’s First Amendment, what is?” But internet archive sleuths soon established the deleted tweets were pornographic or nude images of Hunter Biden that violated Twitter’s ban on nonconsensually posted sexual material, something Taibbi seemingly had not known. “No, you do not have a Constitutional right to post Hunter Biden’s dick pic on Twitter,” [the Bulwark’s Tim Miller wrote](https://www.thebulwark.com/no-you-do-not-have-a-constitutional-right-to-post-hunter-bidens-dick-pic-on-twitter/). Additionally, some fear that the documents are being selectively pruned to tell a preferred story that could lack context.

因此，自由派倾向于用深深的怀疑来看待他们说的任何话，这种本能似乎在塔比发布他的第一份报告后很快得到了证明。他特别提到了一封电子邮件，称拜登竞选团队在2020年10月发出了删除某些推文的请求，并写道一名高管回应道：“已处理。”对于这一爆料，马斯克义愤填膺地回应道：“如果这不是违反宪法第一修正案，那还有什么违反呢？”但互联网档案侦探很快发现，被删除的推文是亨特·拜登的色情或裸照，违反了推特对非自愿发布性爱内容的禁令，塔比似乎并不知道这一点。《堡垒》的蒂姆·米勒写道：不，你没有宪法权利在推特上发布亨特·拜登的迪克照片。此外，一些人担心，这些文件正在被有选择地删减，以讲述一个可能缺乏背景的首选故事。

Still, it is worth evaluating the documents on their own merits to the extent we can, without a too-hasty dismissal of all Taibbi and Weiss’s arguments or a defense of Twitter’s old management regime. That regime is gone now, but while they were in place, Twitter was a powerful institution that had a major impact on politics, and its decisions deserve scrutiny — just as decisions made by Twitter’s new regime, or [monarch](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/opinion/elon-musk.html), deserve scrutiny. Some of the previous management’s decisions, it seems to me, were wrong, and indeed arguably driven by liberal groupthink. Others I’m less certain about, but they’re at least worth discussing. So here are the main decisions being second-guessed.

尽管如此，我们仍有必要尽我们所能评估这些文件本身的价值，而不是过于仓促地驳斥塔比和韦斯的所有论点，或者为Twitter的旧管理制度辩护。那个政权现在已经不复存在，但在它们存在的时候，Twitter是一个强大的机构，对政治产生了重大影响，它的决定值得审查--就像Twitter的新政权或君主的决定值得审查一样。在我看来，之前管理层的一些决定似乎是错误的，确实可以说是由自由派群体思维推动的。其他的我不太确定，但至少值得讨论。因此，以下是正在进行事后评估的主要决定。

### Was Twitter right to block the New York Post story about Hunter Biden’s laptop?

Twitter屏蔽《纽约邮报》关于亨特·拜登笔记本电脑的报道是正确的吗？

The [first part of the Twitter Files](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598830911776251906), from Taibbi, focuses on Twitter’s October 2020 decision to outright ban links to the first [New York Post story](https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/) about Hunter Biden’s laptop. The ban lasted a little over one day before Twitter lifted it, but the recriminations have continued ever since.

推特文件的第一部分，来自塔比，关注的是推特2020年10月决定彻底禁止指向《纽约邮报》第一篇关于亨特·拜登笔记本电脑的报道的链接。这项禁令持续了一天多一点，然后Twitter解除了禁令，但从那以后，相互指责一直在继续。

Twitter’s justification was that the story violated its policy against posting “hacked materials.” However, the Post said the materials came from a laptop abandoned at a computer repair store, not a hack. There was widespread skepticism of this claim at the time, but there was no evidence for the hack supposition, and none has since emerged. So what was Twitter thinking?

推特的理由是，这篇报道违反了其禁止发布“黑客材料”的政策。然而，《华盛顿邮报》表示，这些材料来自一家电脑修理店被遗弃的笔记本电脑，而不是黑客。当时，人们对这一说法普遍持怀疑态度，但没有证据支持黑客假设，自那以后也没有出现任何证据。那么Twitter是怎么想的呢？

One clue is in [a message](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598835411262279680) by Trust and Safety chief Yoel Roth, who alludes to “the SEVERE risks here and lessons of 2016.” In 2016, there was an effort by the Russian government to interfere with the general election in a way that would hurt Hillary Clinton and Democrats’ prospects. As later documented in the [Mueller report](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download), this effort involved both a “troll farm” of Russian accounts masquerading as Americans to spread false or inflammatory information, and the “hack-and-leak” campaign in which leading Democrats’ emails were stolen and provided to WikiLeaks.

信托和安全负责人约尔·罗斯的一条信息中提供了一个线索，他暗示“这里存在的严重风险和2016年的教训”。2016年，俄罗斯政府曾试图以损害希拉里·克林顿和民主党前景的方式干预大选。正如后来在穆勒报告中记录的那样，这一努力既包括伪装成美国人传播虚假或煽动性信息的俄罗斯账户的“巨魔农场”，也包括民主党主要电子邮件被窃取并提供给维基解密的“黑客泄密”运动。

After Trump won, many leading figures in politics, tech, media, and law enforcement concluded that major social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook should have done more to stop this Russian interference effort and the spread of “misinformation” more generally (with some arguing that this was a problem regardless of electoral impact, and others claiming that this helped or even caused Trump’s victory). Law enforcement officials argued the Russian campaign was illegal and [indicted](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17031772/mueller-indictments-grand-jury) about two dozen Russians believed to be involved in it. Social media companies began to take a more aggressive approach to curbing what they saw as misinformation, and as the 2020 election approached, they met regularly with FBI and other government officials to discuss the dangers of potential new foreign interference campaigns.

特朗普获胜后，政界、科技界、媒体界和执法部门的许多主要人物得出结论，推特和Facebook等主要社交媒体平台应该采取更多措施来阻止俄罗斯的干预努力和更广泛的“错误信息”的传播(一些人认为这是一个问题，而不考虑对选举的影响，另一些人则声称这有助于甚至导致特朗普的胜利)。执法官员辩称，俄罗斯的行动是非法的，并起诉了大约20多名据信参与其中的俄罗斯人。社交媒体公司开始采取更积极的方式来遏制他们眼中的错误信息，随着2020年大选的临近，它们定期与联邦调查局和其他政府官员会面，讨论潜在的新的外国干预活动的危险。

But several issues are being conflated here. Misinformation is (in theory) false information. Foreign propaganda is not necessarily false, but it is being spread by a foreign government with malicious intent (for example, to [inflame America’s divisions](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/19/16504510/ten-gop-twitter-russia)). Hacked material, though, is tricker in part because it often isn’t misinformation — its power comes from its accuracy. Now, it is theoretically possible that false information could be mixed in with true information as part of a hacked document dump, so it’s important to authenticate it to the extent possible. And even authentic information can often be ripped out of context to appear more damning than it really is. Still, Twitter was putting itself in the awkward position where it would be resolving to suppress information that could well be accurate, for the greater good of preventing foreign interference in an election.

但有几个问题在这里被混为一谈。错误信息(理论上)是虚假信息。外国宣传不一定是虚假的，但它是由外国政府恶意传播的(例如，煽动美国的分裂)。然而，被黑客入侵的材料更难处理，部分原因是它通常不是错误信息--它的力量来自于它的准确性。现在，从理论上讲，虚假信息可能与真实信息混合在一起，作为被黑客攻击的文档转储的一部分，因此在可能的范围内对其进行身份验证非常重要。而且，即使是真实的信息，也经常会被断章取义，看起来比实际情况更具侮辱性。尽管如此，Twitter还是把自己置于一个尴尬的境地，为了防止外国干预选举的更大好处，它决心压制很可能准确的信息。

More broadly, a blanket ban on hacked material doesn’t seem particularly well thought through, since a fair amount of journalism is based on material that is illicitly obtained in some way (such as the [Pentagon Papers](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-new-york-times-publishes-the-pentagon-papers)). Every major media source wrote about the [DNC](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/23/12261020/dnc-email-leaks-explained) and [Podesta](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/20/13308108/wikileaks-podesta-hillary-clinton) email leaks, as well as the leaked [State Department cables](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/world/statessecrets.html?_r=0), while entertainment journalists wrote about the [Sony hack](https://www.vox.com/2014/12/12/7377685/sony-hack-drama). Should all those stories be banned like the Post’s was? A standard that Twitter won’t host any sexual images of someone posted without their consent, or any personal information like someone’s address, is a neutral one. Beyond that, determining what stolen or hacked information is newsworthy is inherently subjective. Should that judgment be left to social media companies?

更广泛地说，全面禁止黑客材料似乎并没有经过深思熟虑，因为相当多的新闻是基于以某种方式非法获得的材料(如五角大楼文件)。每一家主要媒体都报道了民主党全国委员会和波德斯塔的电子邮件泄露事件，以及国务院泄露的电报，而娱乐记者则报道了索尼的黑客攻击事件。所有这些报道都应该像《华盛顿邮报》那样被禁止吗？推特不会在未经同意的情况下发布任何性爱照片，或者任何个人信息，如某人的地址，这一标准是中立的。除此之外，确定哪些被盗或被黑客窃取的信息具有新闻价值，本质上是主观的。这个判断应该留给社交媒体公司吗？

Then there’s the problem that Twitter jumped to the conclusion that this was a hack in the first place. I can see why they did — recent high-profile examples of mass personal info dumps like this were generally hacks. So if you had been anticipating a chance to “do over” 2016’s hack scandal, here it seemed to be. But it was jumping to a conclusion. Additionally, the apparent belief of some employees that proactively censoring the story until there was more information about whether it was hacked info was a way to express “[caution](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598836516553641989)” seems dubious — fully banning a link to a media outlet from the platform was a sweeping measure.

还有一个问题是，推特一开始就得出结论，认为这是一次黑客攻击。我明白他们为什么这样做了--最近像这样的大规模个人信息转储的高调例子通常都是黑客。因此，如果你一直期待着有机会重温2016年的黑客丑闻，那么它似乎就在这里。但它正在仓促下结论。此外，一些员工显然认为，主动审查这篇报道，直到有更多信息表明它是否被黑客入侵，这是一种表达“谨慎”的方式，这似乎令人怀疑--全面禁止该平台上的媒体链接是一种全面的措施。

So to me this seems a pretty clear case of overreach by Twitter. This wasn’t a “rigging” of the election (again, the ban was only in place for a little over a day). But the decision — born out of a blinkered focus on avoiding a repeat of 2016, rather than taking speech or press freedom or the different details of this situation into account — was the wrong call, in my view.

因此，在我看来，这似乎是Twitter越权的一个非常明显的例子。这并不是选举的“舞弊”(同样，禁令只实施了一天多一点)。但在我看来，这一决定是错误的--出于对避免2016年重演的盲目关注，而不是考虑言论、新闻自由或这种情况的不同细节。

### Was Twitter right to ban Trump?  
推特封杀特朗普对吗？  

Parts [3](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1601352083617505281), [4](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1601720455005511680), and [5](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602364197194432515?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) of the Twitter Files all focus on the company’s decision to ban President Trump’s account in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack. They show that as pressure for the company to act against Trump rose from both [outside voices](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1601724559836983296) and [their own employees](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602373896648282112), Twitter leaders applied various standards in determining Trump’s account shouldn’t yet be banned, before making a rather abrupt switch in deciding to ban him on January 8, [saying](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension) two tweets of his that day violated their “glorification of violence” policy and that Trump’s account presented a “risk of further incitement of violence.”

Twitter文件的第3、4和5部分都集中在该公司在2021年1月6日攻击事件发生后决定禁止特朗普总统的账户。他们显示，随着外部声音和员工对公司采取行动的压力增加，推特领导人应用了各种标准来确定特朗普的账户还不应该被禁止，然后在1月8日做出了相当突然的改变，决定禁止他，称他当天的两条推文违反了他们的“美化暴力”政策，特朗普的账户带来了“进一步煽动暴力的风险”。

Weiss points out that, earlier in the day, Twitter staffers evaluated those new Trump tweets — one saying he wouldn’t attend the inauguration, another that “75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me” will “not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” — and [concluded](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602366973089697792) they did not violate policies against incitement of violence. Only later did top executives ask about other possible interpretations and begin discussing whether this was a coded “glorification of violence” interpretation. Weiss’s implication is that, under immense internal and external pressure, Twitter’s executives searched for a pretext to ban Trump, and found one. (The day before, Facebook [had done something similar](https://onezero.medium.com/facebook-chucked-its-own-rulebook-to-ban-trump-ecc036947f5d).)

韦斯指出，当天早些时候，推特工作人员对特朗普的这些新推文进行了评估--一条说他不会参加就职典礼，另一条说“7500万投票给我的伟大的美国爱国者”将“不会受到任何方式、形式或形式的不尊重或不公平对待！”--并得出结论，这些推文没有违反反对煽动暴力的政策。直到后来，最高层管理人员才询问其他可能的解释，并开始讨论这是否是一种暗含的“美化暴力”的解释。韦斯的意思是，在巨大的内部和外部压力下，Twitter的高管寻找了禁止特朗普的借口，并找到了一个。(此前一天，Facebook也做了类似的事情。)

Weiss also points out that this was the only time a sitting head of state was banned from the platform, and that Twitter previously allowed wide latitude to world leaders’ accounts, even those who posted [hateful rhetoric](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602370518585221120) or even [direct calls to violence](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602371899723431937) (though it’s not a surprise that social media companies would have different standards in different countries with very different political situations and that they might treat the company’s home country somewhat differently).

韦斯还指出，这是唯一一次在任国家元首被禁止进入该平台，而且Twitter之前允许世界各国领导人的账户拥有很大的自由度，即使是那些发布仇恨言论甚至直接呼吁暴力的人(尽管社交媒体公司在不同的政治形势下会有不同的标准并不令人惊讶，他们可能会以不同的方式对待公司的母国)。

Even if you accept Trump was treated differently, the question is whether that different treatment was justified and called for considering what Trump had done: launched a months-long campaign of constant falsehoods aimed at pressuring Republicans to steal the election from Joe Biden, a campaign that eventually spiraled into real-world violence when a mob stormed the US Capitol. In the view of many, American democracy was at stake here — it was not yet clear whether Trump really would step aside, and many feared further violence — so social media companies had a responsibility to act rather than enable its destruction. ([Roth said](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602373896648282112) multiple Twitter employees had quoted Hannah Arendt’s _The Banality of Evil_ to him, suggesting the company’s blind adherence to process meant enabling something horrifying.)

即使你接受特朗普受到不同对待，问题是这种不同待遇是否合理，并呼吁考虑特朗普的所作所为：发起了一场持续数月的不断造假的竞选活动，旨在迫使共和党人从乔·拜登(Joe Biden)手中窃取选举，当一群暴徒袭击美国国会大厦时，这场竞选最终演变为现实世界的暴力。在许多人看来，美国的民主岌岌可危--目前尚不清楚特朗普是否真的会下台，许多人担心会发生进一步的暴力事件--所以社交媒体公司有责任采取行动，而不是任由它被摧毁。(罗斯说，Twitter的多名员工向他引用了汉娜·阿伦特的《邪恶的平庸》，暗示公司盲目遵守流程意味着要制造一些可怕的东西。)

What this really boils down to is a larger clash of worldviews related to Trump, and to which institutions should or should not be trusted.

这实际上归根结底是与特朗普有关的更大的世界观冲突，以及哪些机构应该信任或不应该信任。

One worldview — accepted to varying degrees by liberals, anti-Trump conservatives, and significant portions of the tech and media industries — was that Trump’s presidency was an unprecedented threat to US democracy, that he was enabling a rise of hate toward minority groups that put lives at risk, that his constant lies amounted to an assault on the truth, and that a society-wide effort to resist him was necessary. “Business as usual” in media or tech companies is no longer tenable if you believe your country is sliding into authoritarianism, this argument goes. Journalists and tech workers [shouldn’t be neutral](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/business/balance-fairness-and-a-proudly-provocative-presidential-candidate.html) toward the prospect of American democracy ending, they should instead take a values-based stand in defense of it — and in defense of truth itself.

自由派、反特朗普的保守派以及科技和媒体行业的大部分人都不同程度地接受了一种世界观，即特朗普的总统任期是对美国民主的前所未有的威胁，他正在助长对危及生命的少数群体的仇恨，他不断的谎言相当于对真相的攻击，全社会努力抵制他是必要的。这种观点认为，如果你认为你的国家正在滑向威权主义，那么媒体或科技公司的“一切照旧”不再站得住脚。记者和科技工作者不应该对美国民主结束的前景保持中立，相反，他们应该采取基于价值观的立场来捍卫它--并捍卫真理本身。

The violence of January 6 heightened concerns of further violent turmoil and pushed more people into this camp. “I’ve been part of the ‘he’s the president, we can’t deactivate him’ crowd for 4 years now but even I have to say, I feel complicit allowing this to happen and I would like to see him deactivated immediately,” one Twitter employee wrote in the company’s Slack, [according to NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-youtube-twitter-remove-video-trump-amid-chaos-capitol-n1253157).

1月6日的暴力事件加剧了人们对进一步暴力骚乱的担忧，并将更多人推入这个营地。据NBC新闻报道，一名推特员工在公司的Slack中写道：“四年来，我一直是‘他是总统，我们不能停用他’这群人中的一员，但即使是我也不得不说，我觉得自己是同谋，允许这一切发生，我希望看到他立即停用。”

In contrast, the journalists reporting on the Twitter Files, as well as Musk himself, have a starkly different interpretation of politics. They aren’t Trumpists (Taibbi is historically of the left, [Weiss said](https://www.thefp.com/p/its-done-what-comes-next) she voted for Biden, Musk said [he supports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/11/26/elon-musk-ron-desantis-election/) Ron DeSantis) but they’ve become united by a loathing for what they see as the liberal groupthink that has become hegemonic in much of the media and Silicon Valley, which they argue chills dissent and free speech, and often advances the interests of the Democratic Party. This includes “wokeness” and cancel culture, but goes beyond those topics. For instance, they believe Trump got a raw deal in the Russia investigation — arguing many in the media, the Democratic Party, and the government either believed or willfully perpetrated what amounted to a false conspiracy theory that Trump was in cahoots with Vladimir Putin. Whatever they might believe about Trump’s flaws, their commentary shows that for some time they have been far more animated by what they see as the excesses of Trump’s opponents in the media, tech companies, and the government.

相比之下，在Twitter文件上报道的记者，以及马斯克本人，对政治的解读截然不同。他们不是特朗普主义者(塔伊比历来属于左翼，韦斯说她把票投给了拜登，马斯克说他支持罗恩·德桑蒂斯)，但他们团结在一起的原因是，他们对他们眼中的自由派思想感到厌恶，这种思想在许多媒体和硅谷变得霸道，他们辩称，这让异见和言论自由令人不寒而栗，并经常促进民主党的利益。这包括“Wokness”和取消文化，但超越了这些主题。例如，他们认为特朗普在俄罗斯调查中得到了不公平的待遇--辩称媒体、民主党和政府中的许多人要么相信，要么故意制造了相当于虚假阴谋论的东西，即特朗普与弗拉基米尔·普京串通。无论他们相信特朗普的缺点，他们的评论表明，一段时间以来，他们更多地被他们认为特朗普在媒体、科技公司和政府中的对手的过分行为所激励。

If you’re inclined to think Trump a singular threat that must be resisted — and you can point to the January 6 attacks as proof of your theory — then a major social media company banning him is more justifiable. But if you think the liberals at the social media company are themselves a major threat to speech, then the power they wielded in banning Trump may disquiet you.

如果你倾向于认为特朗普是一个必须抵制的独特威胁--你可以指出1月6日的袭击事件就是你的理论的证据--那么大型社交媒体公司禁止他的说法更有道理。但是，如果你认为这家社交媒体公司的自由派本身就是言论的主要威胁，那么他们在禁止特朗普方面拥有的权力可能会让你感到不安。

Yet it should be noted that the phenomenon of controversial Twitter bannings occurring at top executives’ whims has not been solved under the Musk regime. Musk has already decided to [suspend Kanye West’s account](https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-says-twitter-will-suspend-kanye-wests-account-2022-12-02/), [keep a preexisting ban](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/tech/alex-jones-twitter-ban/index.html) on Infowars host Alex Jones in place, and [ban an account](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63978323) tracking flight information for Musk’s private jet (even though [he said last month](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1589414958508691456) his “commitment to free speech” was so strong he would allow that account to keep posting).

然而，应该指出的是，在马斯克政权下，高管突发奇想、引发争议的Twitter封杀现象并未得到解决。马斯克已经决定暂停坎耶·韦斯特的账户，保留对Infowars主持人亚历克斯·琼斯的预先禁令，并禁止一个追踪马斯克私人飞机航班信息的账户(尽管他上个月表示，他对言论自由的承诺如此强烈，以至于他会允许该账户继续发布)。

### Did Twitter — or the Biden administration — overreach in efforts to limit Covid-19 misinformation?

推特--或拜登政府--在限制新冠肺炎虚假信息方面是否做得过火了？

The Twitter Files has not featured a full installment about Covid-19 yet, but Musk has [promised](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1601886758987104256), “It is coming bigtime.” In [part two](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1601007575633305600) of the series, though, Weiss [showed](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1601011428579717121) that Stanford School of Medicine professor Jay Bhattacharya had been placed on a Twitter “Trends Blacklist” — preventing his tweets from showing up in trending topics searches.

推特上的文件还没有包括关于新冠肺炎的完整部分，但马斯克已经承诺，“它是一个重要的时刻到来。”然而，在该系列的第二部分，Weiss显示斯坦福大学医学院教授Jay Bhattacharya已被列入推特“趋势黑名单”--阻止他的推文出现在热门话题搜索中。

After this, Bhattacharya [tweeted that](https://twitter.com/DrJBhattacharya/status/1602052936921939968), during a visit to Twitter headquarters at Musk’s invitation this week, employees told him he was placed on that blacklist the first day he joined Twitter, in August 2021 and that he [believes](https://twitter.com/DrJBhattacharya/status/1602052938196602881) it must have been because of this tweet:

在此之后，巴塔查里亚在推特上写道，本周应马斯克的邀请访问推特总部时，员工告诉他，他在2021年8月加入推特的第一天就被列入了黑名单，他认为这一定是因为这条推文：

The link there was to the [Great Barrington Declaration](https://gbdeclaration.org/), a controversial October 2020 open letter by Bhattacharya and two other professors arguing that only those people most vulnerable to the virus should continue to lock down and distance, while everyone else should “resume life as normal,” which would result in them getting the virus and, hopefully, “herd immunity” in the population. Shortly afterward, 80 other public health experts [responded with their own letter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/health/coronavirus-great-barrington.html) calling their herd immunity theory “a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence.”

其中的联系是与大巴灵顿宣言有关，这是巴塔查里亚和其他两名教授在2020年10月发表的一封有争议的公开信，信中提出，只有那些最容易感染病毒的人应该继续封锁和保持距离，而其他所有人都应该“恢复正常生活”，这将导致他们感染病毒，并有望在人群中获得“群体免疫”。不久之后，其他80名公共卫生专家以他们自己的信件回应，称他们的群体免疫理论是“一个没有科学证据支持的危险的谬论”。

When the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, Twitter again grappled with the topic of “misinformation.” As with Trump (and with hate speech), Twitter executives likely believed lives could well hinge on their decisions. So by May 2020, the company [announced](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/11/853886052/twitter-to-label-potentially-harmful-coronavirus-tweets) it would remove or label tweets that “directly pose a risk to someone’s health or well-being,” such as encouragements that people disregard social distancing guidelines.

当新冠肺炎疫情爆发时，推特又一次陷入了“误传”的话题。就像特朗普(以及仇恨言论)一样，Twitter的高管可能认为，生活很可能取决于他们的决定。因此，该公司宣布，到2020年5月，它将删除或贴上标签，即“直接对某人的健康或福祉构成风险”的推文，例如鼓励人们无视社交疏远指导原则的推文。

But the company essentially defined “misinformation” as whatever went against the public health establishment’s current conventional wisdom. And as time passed, Covid quickly became another issue where conservatives and some journalists came to deeply distrust that establishment, viewing it as [making mistakes](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/opinion-free-expression/the-mistakes-made-responding-to-covid-19/e91792e5-d091-496b-9fc9-d434c5cba5e0) and giving [politically slanted guidance](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/04/public-health-protests-301534).

但该公司本质上将“错误信息”定义为任何与公共卫生机构当前的传统智慧背道而驰的东西。随着时间的推移，Covid迅速成为另一个问题，保守派和一些记者开始深深地不信任这个建制派，认为它犯了错误，并提供了政治上的倾斜指导。

The situation took another turn when President Biden took office. By the summer of 2021, his administration was trying to encourage widespread vaccine adoption in the hope the pandemic could be ended entirely. (The omicron variant, which sufficiently evaded vaccines to end that hope, was not yet circulating.) Toward that end, administration officials [publicly](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/white-house-social-networks-should-be-held-accountable-for-spreading-misinfo.html) demanded social companies do more to fight misinformation, and poured private pressure on the companies [to delete certain specific accounts](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/tech/misinformation-covid-facebook-twitter-white-house/index.html).

拜登总统上任后，情况出现了另一个转折。到2021年夏天，他的政府试图鼓励广泛采用疫苗，希望能完全结束大流行。(奥米克隆的变种还没有在市场上传播，这种变种充分地避开了疫苗，终结了这种希望。)为此，政府官员公开要求社交公司采取更多措施打击虚假信息，并向这些公司施加私下压力，要求它们删除某些特定的账户。

One of those accounts belonged to commentator Alex Berenson, who “has mischaracterized just about every detail regarding the vaccines to make the dubious case that most people would be better off avoiding them,” according to [the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/pandemics-wrongest-man/618475/). After Berenson was eventually banned, he sued and [obtained records](https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-becomes-a-tool-of-government-censors-alex-berenson-twitter-facebook-ban-covid-misinformation-first-amendment-psaki-murthy-section-230-antitrust-11660732095) showing the White House had specifically asked Twitter why he hadn’t been kicked off the platform yet. Another lawsuit against the administration, from Republican state attorneys general and other people who believed their speech was suppressed (including Bhattacharya), [is also pending](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520.45.0.pdf).

其中一个账户属于评论员亚历克斯·贝伦森，据《大西洋月刊》的德里克·汤普森称，贝伦森“错误地描述了有关疫苗的几乎每一个细节，从而得出了大多数人最好避免接种疫苗的可疑论据。”在贝伦森最终被禁止后，他提起诉讼，并获得了记录，显示白宫曾明确询问Twitter，为什么他还没有被踢出该平台。另一起针对政府的诉讼，来自共和党州总检察长和其他认为他们的言论被压制的人(包括巴塔查里亚)，也正在审理中。

All that is to say that there is a thorny question here about whether the government should be trying to get individual people who have violated no laws banned from social media. And from the standpoint of 2022, when the US has adopted a return-to-normal policy without universal vaccination or the virus being suppressed, and when there’s increased attention on whether [school lockdowns harmed children](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/briefing/school-closures-covid-learning-loss.html), some reflection may be called for about what constitutes misinformation and what constitutes opinions people may have about policy in a free society.

总而言之，这里有一个棘手的问题，即政府是否应该试图让没有违反任何法律的个人在社交媒体上露面。从2022年的角度来看，当美国在没有普及疫苗或抑制病毒的情况下采取回归正常的政策，当人们越来越多地关注学校封锁是否会伤害儿童时，可能需要反思什么构成错误信息，什么构成人们对自由社会中的政策的看法。
