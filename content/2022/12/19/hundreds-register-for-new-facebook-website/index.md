When Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06 grew impatient with the creation of an official universal Harvard facebook, he decided to take matters into his own hands.

当马克·E·扎克伯格06年对创建一个官方通用的哈佛Facebook感到不耐烦时，他决定自己解决问题。

After about a week of coding, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com last Wednesday afternoon. The website combines elements of a standard House face book with extensive profile features that allow students to search for others in their courses, social organizations and Houses.

经过大约一周的编码，扎克伯格于上周三下午推出了thefacebook.com。该网站结合了标准House Face Book的元素和广泛的个人资料功能，允许学生在他们的课程、社会组织和房屋中搜索其他人。

“Everyone’s been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard,” Zuckerberg said. “I think it’s kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week.”

扎克伯格说：“每个人都在谈论哈佛大学内部的通用面书。”“我觉得这有点傻，大学要花几年时间才能做到这一点。”我可以比他们做得更好，而且我一周就能做完。

As of yesterday afternoon, Zuckerberg said over 650 students had registered use thefacebook.com. He said that he anticipated that 900 students would have joined the site by this morning.

扎克伯格表示，截至昨天下午，已有超过650名学生使用thefacebook.com注册。他说，他预计到今天早上，将有900名学生加入该网站。

“I’m pretty happy with the amount of people that have been to it so far,” he said. “The nature of the site is that each user’s experience improves if they can get their friends to join it.”

他说：“到目前为止，我对前来参加的人数感到非常满意。”“这个网站的本质是，如果每个用户都能让他们的朋友加入，他们的体验就会改善。”

But Director of Residential Computing Kevin S. Davis ’98 said that the creation of a Harvard facebook was not as far off as Zuckerberg predicted.

但住宅计算总监凯文·S·戴维斯说，哈佛Facebook的创建并不像扎克伯格预测的那样遥远。

“There is a project internally with computer services to create a facebook,” Davis said. “We’ve been in touch with the Undergraduate Council, and this is a very high priority for the College. We have every intention of completing the facebook by the end of the spring semester.”

戴维斯说：“有一个内部计算机服务项目，目的是创建一个Facebook。”“我们已经与本科生委员会取得了联系，这对学院来说是非常重要的。我们完全有计划在春季学期结束前完成Facebook。

Davis said that the principle complication with the creation of an official facebook was figuring out how to design an interface so that directory information could not easily be compiled without authorization.

戴维斯说，创建一个官方Facebook的主要复杂之处在于，如何设计一个界面，使目录信息在未经授权的情况下无法轻松编译。

Zuckerberg’s site allows people with Harvard e-mail addresses to upload their pictures and personal and academic information. Just as with the popular website Friendster, which Zuckerberg said was a model for his new website, members can search for people according to their interests and can create an online network of friends.

扎克伯格的网站允许拥有哈佛电子邮件地址的人上传他们的照片以及个人和学术信息。就像广受欢迎的Friendster网站一样，扎克伯格称Friendster是他新网站的典范，会员可以根据他们的兴趣搜索人，并可以创建一个在线朋友网络。

Lisa H. Feigenbaum ’04 said that she joined thefacebook.com because it provided an open alternative to the password-protected House facebooks.

丽莎·H·费根鲍姆说，她加入thefacebook.com是因为它为受密码保护的House facebook提供了一个开放的替代方案。

“If there was a situation where you needed to identify someone for an organization or a meeting, it would be very helpful,” she said.

她说：“如果出现需要为某个组织或会议确定人选的情况，这将非常有帮助。”

Zuckerberg said that the most innovative feature of the site is that people can search for other students in their classes so that they can branch out to form friendships and study groups.

扎克伯格说，该网站最具创新性的特点是，人们可以搜索班上的其他学生，这样他们就可以扩展到结交友谊和学习小组。

“If you’re in a class where you don’t vknow anyone and want to ask somebody for help, this is a way to find out the names of people in that class,” said thefacebook.com user Roberto C. Acosta ’05.

Thefacebook.com用户Roberto C.Acosta‘05说：“如果你在一个不认识任何人的班级里，想找人帮忙，这是一种查出同班同学名字的方法。”

Zuckerberg said that the extensive search capabilities are restricted by a myriad of privacy options for members who do not want everyone to be able to look up their information.

扎克伯格说，对于那些不希望每个人都能查询他们的信息的成员来说，广泛的搜索能力受到了无数隐私选择的限制。

“There are pretty intensive privacy options,” he said. “You can limit who can see your information, if you only want current students to see your information, or people in your year, in your house, in your classes. You can limit a search so that only a friend or a friend of a friend can look you up. People have very good control over who can see their information.”

“有相当密集的隐私选项，”他说。如果你只想让在校学生看到你的信息，或者你同年的人，在你的房子里，在你的班级里，你可以限制谁可以看到你的信息。您可以限制搜索范围，以便只有朋友或朋友的朋友才能查找您。人们可以很好地控制谁可以看到他们的信息。

Zuckerberg said that he hoped the privacy options would help to restore his reputation following student outrage over facemash.com, a website he created in the fall semester.

扎克伯格说，在学生们对他在秋季学期创建的网站facemash.com感到愤怒后，他希望隐私选项能帮助恢复他的声誉。

Using without permission photos from House facebooks, Facemash juxtaposed the pictures of two random Harvard undergraduates and asked users to judge their physical attractiveness. The website drew the ire of students and administrators alike, and Zuckerberg shut it down within days of the initial launch.

在未经允许的情况下，Facemash使用了House Facebook上的照片，将两名随机的哈佛本科生的照片并列在一起，并要求用户判断他们的外表吸引力。该网站引起了学生和管理人员的愤怒，扎克伯格在最初推出几天后就关闭了它。

In addition to the privacy options, Zuckerberg added security features to thefacebook.com that he said will ensure that only the owner of a particular Harvard e-mail account can upload information to the website.

除了隐私选项，扎克伯格还为thefacebook.com增加了安全功能，他说这些功能将确保只有特定哈佛电子邮件账户的所有者才能将信息上传到网站。

When a person registers to join thefacebook.com, a program checks to make sure that the name of the prospective member matches up with the entered e-mail address. Next, a confirmation message is sent to the e-mail account, and the account is finally activated if and when the owner of the account clicks on an encrypted link back to thefacebook.com.

当一个人注册加入thefacebook.com时，一个程序会进行检查，以确保潜在成员的名字与输入的电子邮件地址匹配。接下来，向该电子邮件帐户发送一条确认消息，如果该帐户的所有者点击返回thefacebook.com的加密链接，则该帐户最终被激活。

Zuckerberg said that he was also careful to avoid the potential copyright infringement charges that landed him before the Administrative Board after the creation of Facemash.

扎克伯格说，他也小心翼翼地避免了潜在的侵犯版权的指控，这些指控使他在Facemash创建后向管理委员会提出了指控。

“Facemash was a joke, it was funny, but at its root it had its problems—not only the idea, but the implementation. It was distributing materials that were Harvard’s. I was very careful with \[thefacebook.com\] to make sure that people don’t upload copyrighted material,” he said.

“Facemash是个笑话，很好笑，但从根本上说，它有自己的问题--不仅是想法，还有实施。它是在分发哈佛的材料。我非常小心地对待\[thefacebook.com\]，以确保人们不会上传受版权保护的材料。

Davis said that thefacebook.com is not necessarily in violation of any Harvard rules.

戴维斯说，thefacebook.com不一定违反任何哈佛大学的规定。

“There’s nothing inherently wrong with a third party site on which students choose to create a personal network,” Davis said. “If there was a third party site on which students uploaded course syllabi or videos, that could potentially become a property issue with the University.”

戴维斯说：“学生选择在第三方网站上创建个人网络，这本身并没有错。”如果有第三方网站让学生上传课程大纲或视频，这可能会成为大学的财产问题。

Zuckerburg said thefacebook.com has no such capabilities and does not violate University rules.

扎克伯格表示，thefacebook.com没有这样的能力，也没有违反大学的规定。

While Zuckerberg promised that thefacebook.com would boast new features by the end of the week, he said that he did not create the website with the intention of generating revenue.

虽然扎克伯格承诺thefacebook.com将在本周末之前推出新功能，但他表示，他创建该网站的目的并不是为了创造收入。

“I’m not going to sell anybody’s e-mail address,” he said. “At one point I thought about making the website so that you could upload a resume too, and for a fee companies could search for Harvard job applicants. But I don’t want to touch that. It would make everything more serious and less fun.”

“我不会出售任何人的电子邮件地址，”他说。“我一度想过做一个网站，这样你也可以上传一份简历，公司也可以收费搜索哈佛的求职者。但我不想碰那个。这会让一切变得更加严肃，变得不那么有趣。
